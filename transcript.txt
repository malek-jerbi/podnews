0.00 - 1.86: the war continues after the battle's end 1.86 - 2.88: this is something that's hard for 2.88 - 4.38: Americans to understand our system is 4.38 - 5.76: built with the presumption when War is 5.76 - 7.38: Over when we signed a piece of paper 7.38 - 9.54: everyone can go home 9.54 - 12.66: that's not what happens 12.66 - 14.34: the following is a conversation with 14.34 - 17.30: Jeremy Surrey a historian a UT Austin 17.30 - 20.04: this is the Lex Friedman podcast to 20.04 - 21.60: support it please check out our sponsors 21.60 - 24.56: in the description and now dear friends 24.56 - 27.66: here's Jeremy sorry 27.66 - 30.48: what is the main idea the the main case 30.48 - 32.40: that you make in your new book Civil War 32.40 - 34.74: by other means America's long and 34.74 - 37.26: unfinished fight for democracy so our 37.26 - 39.00: Democratic institutions in the United 39.00 - 41.40: States they are filled with many virtues 41.40 - 44.58: and many elements in their design that 44.58 - 46.20: improve our society and allow for 46.20 - 48.30: Innovation but they also have many flaws 48.30 - 50.10: in them as any institutions created by 50.10 - 52.68: human beings have and the flaws in our 52.68 - 55.38: institutions go back to a number of 55.38 - 57.60: judgments and perspectives 57.60 - 60.30: that people on the 17th 18th and 19th 60.30 - 62.70: centuries had and those flaws have been 62.70 - 64.74: built into our institutions and they 64.74 - 67.74: continue to hinder Innovation and growth 67.74 - 69.90: in our society three of the flaws that I 69.90 - 72.84: emphasize in this book are flaws of 72.84 - 74.04: exclusion 74.04 - 75.72: the ways our institutions exclude people 75.72 - 77.70: not just African Americans many 77.70 - 80.04: different groups the ways our 80.04 - 83.22: institutions also give power to certain 83.22 - 85.56: people who have position rather than 85.56 - 88.38: skill or intelligence or quality 88.38 - 90.36: and third in most of all the ways our 90.36 - 92.58: institutions embed certain myths in our 92.58 - 95.40: society myths that prevent us from 95.40 - 97.26: Gaining the knowledge we need to improve 97.26 - 99.24: our world in all of these ways our 99.24 - 102.42: democracy is hindered by the false 102.42 - 103.56: reverence 103.56 - 105.60: for institutions that actually need to 105.60 - 107.88: be reformed just as we need to highlight 107.88 - 109.38: the good elements of them that's really 109.38 - 111.12: what my book is about and then the myth 111.12 - 114.12: the the false reverence what are we 114.12 - 115.74: talking about that so there's a way in 115.74 - 118.56: which uh we believe that if we love our 118.56 - 121.08: country it's somehow wrong to criticize 121.08 - 123.00: our institutions I believe if you love 123.00 - 124.92: your country you want to encourage your 124.92 - 126.66: institutions to get better and better I 126.66 - 128.34: love my University where I work but I 128.34 - 129.72: want it to be better we have many flaws 129.72 - 131.34: I love my family but I'm constantly 131.34 - 132.90: telling family members how they can be 132.90 - 136.02: better that's what true knowledge 136.02 - 138.00: leadership is about not just 138.00 - 139.86: cheerleading what's the Counterpoint to 139.86 - 142.86: that because uh The Other Extreme is a 142.86 - 144.26: deep 144.26 - 146.70: all-encompassing cynicism towards 146.70 - 147.84: institutions 147.84 - 151.32: so for me I like the idea of loving 151.32 - 153.72: America which seems to be sometimes a 153.72 - 156.06: politicized statement these days 156.06 - 157.92: that you believe in the ideals of this 157.92 - 161.04: country that seems to be uh that seems 161.04 - 162.54: to be either a naive or a political 162.54 - 164.10: statement the way it's interpreted so 164.10 - 166.26: the flip side of that having a healthy 166.26 - 168.30: skepticism of Institutions is good but 168.30 - 170.22: having a complete paralyzing cynicism 170.22 - 173.34: seems to be bad absolutely both are a 173.34 - 175.68: historical positions what I try to do as 175.68 - 177.30: a historian is work in between those 177.30 - 179.64: spaces The Virtue is is in the Middle 179.64 - 182.28: Ground For Better or For Worse and uh 182.28 - 184.56: what we have to recognize is that our 184.56 - 186.66: institutions are necessary there's a 186.66 - 189.00: reason government exists there's a 189.00 - 191.70: reason uh our Union was created that's 191.70 - 193.38: what Abraham Lincoln was heroically 193.38 - 195.84: fighting for uh so we have to believe in 195.84 - 197.34: our Union we have to believe in our 197.34 - 199.44: government and we as business people as 199.44 - 201.54: intellectuals we have to be part of the 201.54 - 203.76: solution not the problem but that 203.76 - 206.40: doesn't mean uh just ignoring the Deep 206.40 - 208.32: flaws in our institutions even if we 208.32 - 210.18: find personally ways to get around them 210.18 - 212.58: what really worries me is that there are 212.58 - 214.20: a lot of very intelligent well 214.20 - 216.00: well-intentioned people in our society 216.00 - 218.58: who are figured out how to live with the 218.58 - 220.62: flaws in our institutions rather than 220.62 - 222.42: how to use their skills to correct the 222.42 - 224.58: flaws in our institutions there's folks 224.58 - 226.44: like uh somebody that lives next door to 226.44 - 229.56: me Michael malice is an anarchists 229.56 - 231.30: um philosophically maybe more than 231.30 - 233.46: practically just sort of August of that 233.46 - 234.84: position 234.84 - 236.10: um it's it's an interesting thought 236.10 - 238.50: experiment I would say and 238.50 - 240.48: so if you have these flaws as 240.48 - 242.76: institutions one thing to do 242.76 - 244.50: as the Communists did at the beginning 244.50 - 246.12: of the 20th century is to burn the thing 246.12 - 249.30: down and start in you and the other is 249.30 - 253.50: to fix from within one step one slow 253.50 - 255.54: step at a time what's what's the case 255.54 - 257.88: for both from a history perspective sure 257.88 - 260.58: so historically there has uh always been 260.58 - 262.20: an urge to burn down the institutions 262.20 - 264.00: and start again start with a blank slate 264.00 - 265.80: uh the historical record is that almost 265.80 - 267.78: never works because what happens when 267.78 - 269.22: you destroy the institutions you gave 269.22 - 271.86: the example of the Bolshevik Revolution 271.86 - 274.50: when you destroy the institutions all 274.50 - 276.60: you do is in the jungle that's left 276.60 - 278.82: behind you give advantages to those who 278.82 - 280.92: are the most powerful institutions 280.92 - 283.68: always Place certain limits upon the 283.68 - 285.24: most powerful in the jungle if you go 285.24 - 287.10: back to the Jungle the most powerful are 287.10 - 288.66: actually going to have the most 288.66 - 290.76: influence and most control so the 290.76 - 292.08: revolutionaries who are usually the 292.08 - 294.36: vulnerable turn out to then be the 294.36 - 295.80: victims of the Revolution and this is 295.80 - 297.36: exactly what we saw with the French 297.36 - 298.68: Revolution with the Russian Revolution 298.68 - 300.66: so the record for that is not a great 300.66 - 302.10: record there still might be times to do 302.10 - 304.02: that but I think we should be very 304.02 - 305.46: cautious about that the record for 305.46 - 307.44: working through institutions is better 307.44 - 309.60: record now what we have to be careful 309.60 - 310.80: about is as we're working through 310.80 - 312.60: institutions not to become bought into 312.60 - 315.00: them not to become of those institutions 315.00 - 317.22: so what I've written about in this book 317.22 - 318.60: and in other books my book on Henry 318.60 - 320.52: Kissinger for example is how it's 320.52 - 322.32: important when in an institution to 322.32 - 324.96: still bring an outsider perspective I 324.96 - 327.90: believe in being an inside Outsider and 327.90 - 329.10: I think most of your listeners are 329.10 - 330.48: inside Outsiders they're people who care 330.48 - 332.52: about what's going on inside but they're 332.52 - 333.84: bringing some new ideas from the outside 333.84 - 335.70: I think the correct statement to say is 335.70 - 337.68: most of the listeners most people aspire 337.68 - 340.64: to be inside or Outsiders 340.64 - 343.86: but we human nature such that we easily 343.86 - 347.34: become Insider Insiders so like uh we 347.34 - 349.98: like that idea but the reality is 349.98 - 351.66: and I've been 351.66 - 353.40: very fortunate because of this podcast 353.40 - 355.74: to talk to certain folks that live in 355.74 - 357.42: certain bubbles 357.42 - 358.80: and 358.80 - 362.16: it's very hard to know when you're in a 362.16 - 363.36: bubble 363.36 - 365.40: that you should get out of the bubble of 365.40 - 366.24: thought 366.24 - 368.04: and that's a really tricky thing because 368.04 - 369.84: like yeah when you're whether it's 369.84 - 372.48: politics whether it's science whether 372.48 - 373.98: it's uh 373.98 - 376.86: and and any Pursuits in life 376.86 - 378.66: because everybody around you all your 378.66 - 380.70: friends you have like a little Rat Race 380.70 - 382.62: and you're competing with each other and 382.62 - 384.18: then you get a promotion you get excited 384.18 - 385.80: and you can see how you can get more and 385.80 - 388.32: more power it's not it's not like a dark 388.32 - 391.92: cynical uh Rat Race it's it's fun that's 391.92 - 394.82: the process of life and then you forget 394.82 - 398.76: that there you just uh collectively have 398.76 - 400.32: created a set of rules for the game that 400.32 - 402.18: you're playing you forget that this game 402.18 - 404.10: doesn't have to have these rules you can 404.10 - 407.10: break them this happens in the uh like 407.10 - 410.28: uh in Wall Street like the financial the 410.28 - 411.78: financial system everybody starts to 411.78 - 413.64: like collectively agree on a set of 413.64 - 415.26: rules that they play and they don't 415.26 - 416.82: realize like we don't have to be playing 416.82 - 419.34: this game it's tough It's really tough 419.34 - 421.08: it takes a special kind of human being 421.08 - 423.20: as opposed to being a 423.20 - 425.16: anti-establishment on everything which 425.16 - 427.68: also gets a lot of uh attention 427.68 - 431.10: but being just enough anti-establishment 431.10 - 433.92: to figure out ideas how to improve the 433.92 - 436.14: establishment this is such a tricky 436.14 - 438.78: place to operate I agree I I like the 438.78 - 441.12: word iconoclastic I think it's important 441.12 - 444.18: to be an iconoclast which is to say you 444.18 - 446.90: love ideas you're serious about ideas 446.90 - 449.16: but you're never comfortable with 449.16 - 450.30: consensus 450.30 - 452.28: and I write about that in this book I've 452.28 - 453.48: written about that actually a lot in the 453.48 - 456.12: New York Times too I I think consensus 456.12 - 457.56: is overstated 457.56 - 460.26: as a as someone who's half Jewish and 460.26 - 462.18: have Hindu I don't want to live in a 462.18 - 463.56: society where everyone agrees because my 463.56 - 464.58: guess is they're going to come after 464.58 - 466.74: people like me I want to live in a 466.74 - 468.84: society that's pluralistic this is what 468.84 - 470.28: Abraham Lincoln was really fighting for 470.28 - 471.60: in The Civil Wars but the Civil War was 471.60 - 473.22: really about and what my book's about 473.22 - 476.10: which is that we need a society where 476.10 - 478.50: institutions encourage as you say 478.50 - 480.72: different modes of thought and respect 480.72 - 482.22: different modes of thought and work 482.22 - 484.68: through disagreement so a society should 484.68 - 486.24: not be a society where everyone agrees a 486.24 - 487.68: Democratic Society should be a society 487.68 - 489.18: where people disagree but can still work 489.18 - 492.54: together that's the Lincoln vision and 492.54 - 493.92: how do you get there I think you get 493.92 - 495.48: there by having a historical perspective 495.48 - 497.40: always knowing that no matter what 497.40 - 499.08: moment you're in and no matter what room 499.08 - 501.42: you're in with really smart people there 501.42 - 503.04: are always things that are missing we 503.04 - 505.20: know that as historians no one is 505.20 - 507.24: Clairvoyant and the iconoclast is 507.24 - 508.50: looking for the things that have been 508.50 - 510.90: forgotten the silence is in the room 510.90 - 512.88: and also 512.88 - 515.52: I wonder what kind of skill what kind of 515.52 - 517.44: process is required for that kind of 517.44 - 520.20: class to reveal what is missing to the 520.20 - 522.60: rest of the room yeah because it's not 522.60 - 524.46: just shouting with a megaphone that 524.46 - 525.78: something is missing because nobody will 525.78 - 526.86: listen to you 526.86 - 529.50: you have to convince them right it's 529.50 - 531.12: honestly where I have trouble myself 531.12 - 532.74: because I often find myself in that I 532.74 - 534.90: kind of classic role and people don't 534.90 - 536.88: like to hear it you know I like to 536.88 - 539.64: believe that people are acting out of 539.64 - 541.08: Goodwill which I think they usually are 541.08 - 542.64: and that people are open to new ideas 542.64 - 545.10: but you find very quickly even those who 545.10 - 546.66: you think are open-minded once they've 546.66 - 548.34: committed themselves and put their money 548.34 - 550.98: and their reputation on the line they 550.98 - 552.96: don't want to hear otherwise so in a 552.96 - 554.52: sense what you say is the bigger than 554.52 - 556.98: even being an iconoclast that's being 556.98 - 558.48: able to persuade and work with people 558.48 - 561.06: who are afraid of your ideas yeah I 561.06 - 562.44: think the the key is like in 562.44 - 565.02: conversations is to get people out of a 565.02 - 567.30: defensive position like uh make them 567.30 - 569.58: realize we're on the same side we're 569.58 - 572.28: brothers and sisters and from that place 572.28 - 574.50: I think you just raise the question it's 574.50 - 576.96: like a little it's a little a little 576.96 - 580.02: thought that just lands and then I've 580.02 - 582.00: noticed this time and time again 582.00 - 584.34: just a little subtle thing and then 584.34 - 587.10: months later it percolates somewhere in 587.10 - 588.48: the mind it's like all right well that 588.48 - 589.92: little doubt 589.92 - 591.84: um because I also realized in these 591.84 - 593.76: battles when dip when especially 593.76 - 595.50: political battles 595.50 - 598.08: people often don't 598.08 - 600.78: have folks on their side 600.78 - 603.96: like that they can really trust 603.96 - 606.60: as a fellow human being to challenge 606.60 - 608.70: them that's a very difficult role to be 608.70 - 611.16: in and because in these battles you kind 611.16 - 612.96: of have a tribe and you have a set of 612.96 - 614.34: ideas and there's another tribe you have 614.34 - 616.32: a set of ideas and when somebody says 616.32 - 618.30: something Conor to your Viewpoint you 618.30 - 619.56: almost always want to put them in the 619.56 - 621.62: other tribe as opposed to having 621.62 - 623.82: truly listening to another person that 623.82 - 626.16: takes uh skill But ultimately I think 626.16 - 628.56: that's the way to bridge these divides 628.56 - 630.50: is having these kinds of conversations 630.50 - 632.54: that's why I'm actually 632.54 - 635.34: again optimistically believe in the 635.34 - 637.26: power of social media to do that if if 637.26 - 640.08: you design it well but currently the 640.08 - 642.60: battle rages on on Twitter well I think 642.60 - 644.58: what you're getting at which is so 644.58 - 648.90: important is uh storytelling and uh all 648.90 - 651.60: the great leaders that I've studied some 651.60 - 652.98: of whom are in this book some of whom 652.98 - 654.24: are not right whether they're 654.24 - 657.48: politicians social activists technology 657.48 - 659.34: technologists 659.34 - 661.38: um it's the story that gets people in 661.38 - 663.78: people don't respond to an argument 663.78 - 666.60: we're trained uh at least in the United 666.60 - 669.54: States we're often trained to argue uh 669.54 - 671.82: you're you're told in a class okay this 671.82 - 673.92: part of the room take this position this 673.92 - 675.48: part of the room take this position and 675.48 - 676.86: that's helpful because it forces you to 676.86 - 678.66: see different sides of the argument but 678.66 - 680.82: in fact those on one side never convince 680.82 - 682.80: those on the other side through argument 682.80 - 684.42: it's through a story that people can 684.42 - 686.70: identify with it's when you bring your 686.70 - 689.16: argument to life in human terms and 689.16 - 691.32: someone again like Abraham Lincoln was a 691.32 - 694.74: master at that uh he told stories uh he 694.74 - 697.56: found ways to disarm people and to move 697.56 - 699.84: them without their even realizing they 699.84 - 702.06: were being moved 702.06 - 706.80: yeah not make it a debate make it uh 706.80 - 708.78: tell a story 708.78 - 710.64: that's fascinating because yes one some 710.64 - 712.80: of the most convincing politicians I 712.80 - 714.00: don't feel like they're arguing a point 714.00 - 715.62: they're just telling a story 715.62 - 717.60: and it gets in there right 717.60 - 719.28: that's right that's right when we look 719.28 - 721.80: at what zielinski has done in Ukraine in 721.80 - 723.96: response to the Russian invasion and I 723.96 - 725.10: know you you were there on the front 725.10 - 726.72: lines yourself 726.72 - 727.44: um 727.44 - 729.48: it's not that he's arguing a position 729.48 - 731.04: that persuaded us we already believe 731.04 - 732.84: what we believed about Russia 732.84 - 734.76: but he's bringing the story of Ukrainian 734.76 - 737.64: suffering to life and making us see the 737.64 - 740.34: behavior of the Russians that is moving 740.34 - 741.36: opinion 741.36 - 743.04: around the world 743.04 - 744.84: well the interesting stuff sometimes 744.84 - 747.18: it's not actually the story told by the 747.18 - 748.62: person but the story told about the 748.62 - 750.30: person right and some of that could be 750.30 - 753.78: propaganda some of that could be uh 753.78 - 755.58: legitimate stories which is the 755.58 - 758.10: fascinating thing the power of story is 758.10 - 760.14: the very power that's leveraged by 760.14 - 763.50: Propaganda to convince the populace but 763.50 - 765.54: the idea one of the most powerful ideas 765.54 - 767.70: when I traveled in Ukraine and in 767.70 - 770.22: general to me personally the idea that 770.22 - 773.82: President zielinski stayed in Kiev in in 773.82 - 776.40: the early days of War on everybody from 776.40 - 778.62: his inner circle to the United States 778.62 - 780.42: everybody in the western NATO everybody 780.42 - 782.70: was telling him uh and even on the 782.70 - 785.76: Russian side I I assumed they thought he 785.76 - 787.56: would leave he would Escape right and he 787.56 - 788.94: didn't 788.94 - 791.58: um from foolishness or from heroism I 791.58 - 794.46: don't know but if that's the story that 794.46 - 796.56: I think United a country and it's such a 796.56 - 799.08: small thing right but it's powerful it's 799.08 - 800.76: the most basic of all human Stories the 800.76 - 803.04: story of human Courage the courage and I 803.04 - 805.08: remember watching uh his social media 805.08 - 807.96: feed on that and he was standing outside 807.96 - 810.66: not even in a bunker standing outside in 810.66 - 812.58: Kiev right as the Russian forces are 812.58 - 814.20: attacking and saying I'm here 814.20 - 816.30: and this minister is here and this 816.30 - 818.70: minister is here we're not corrupt we're 818.70 - 820.80: not Stooges of the Americans who told us 820.80 - 822.72: to leave we're staying because we care 822.72 - 825.24: about Ukraine and the story of Courage I 825.24 - 826.92: mean that's the story that you know 826.92 - 829.20: babies grow up seeing their parents as 829.20 - 830.94: courageous right it's the most natural 830.94 - 832.80: of all stories and that's also the 832.80 - 834.30: stories for better awards that are told 834.30 - 837.14: throughout history yeah uh because 837.14 - 841.44: stories of courage and uh stories of 841.44 - 844.56: evil those the two extremes are the ones 844.56 - 846.90: that are kind of it's a nice mechanism 846.90 - 849.66: to tell the stories of Wars 849.66 - 852.96: um of conflicts of struggles all of it 852.96 - 855.48: yeah yeah the tension between those two 855.48 - 857.82: and the reason I believe studying 857.82 - 859.56: history and writing about history is so 859.56 - 861.48: essential it's because it gives us more 861.48 - 862.44: stories 862.44 - 864.96: uh the problem with much of our world I 864.96 - 866.64: think is that we're confronted by data 866.64 - 869.34: we're confronted by information and of 869.34 - 872.22: course it's valuable but it's easy to 872.22 - 874.80: manipulate or misuse information it's 874.80 - 876.36: the stories that give us a structure 876.36 - 878.10: it's the stories where we find morality 878.10 - 879.78: it's the stories where we find political 879.78 - 882.54: value and what do you get from studying 882.54 - 884.16: history you learn more stories about 884.16 - 885.48: more people 885.48 - 887.88: yeah I'm a sucker for courage for 887.88 - 890.16: stories of Courage like uh I've I've 890.16 - 893.58: been in too many rooms I've often seen 893.58 - 895.44: too many people 895.44 - 898.32: sort of in subtle ways sacrifice their 898.32 - 900.36: integrity and did nothing and people 900.36 - 901.82: that step up 901.82 - 905.88: uh when uh the opinion is unpopular and 905.88 - 907.32: they they do something where they really 907.32 - 908.82: put themselves on the line whether it's 908.82 - 910.68: their money where their well-being I 910.68 - 912.60: don't know that gives me hope about 912.60 - 914.16: Humanity 914.16 - 915.84: um and of course during the war like 915.84 - 918.84: Ukraine you see that more and more now 918.84 - 920.34: other people have a very cynical 920.34 - 922.56: perspective of it that's saying oh those 922.56 - 924.60: are just narratives that are constructed 924.60 - 926.70: for propaganda purposes and so on but 926.70 - 928.26: I've seen it with my own eyes there's 928.26 - 931.68: Heroes out there both small and big so 931.68 - 934.62: just regular citizens and leaders one 934.62 - 936.12: set of Heroes I learned about writing 936.12 - 937.32: this book that I didn't know about that 937.32 - 940.38: I should have are uh more than one 940.38 - 942.84: hundred thousand uh former slaves who 942.84 - 944.70: become Union Soldiers during the Civil 944.70 - 946.32: War which is an extraordinary story we 946.32 - 948.72: think of it as North versus South white 948.72 - 950.22: northern troops versus white Southern 950.22 - 952.80: troops there are as I said more than a 952.80 - 955.56: hundred thousand slaves no education 955.56 - 959.70: never anything other than slaves who 959.70 - 961.68: flee their plantations join the Union 961.68 - 963.72: Army and what I found in the research 963.72 - 964.92: and other historians have written about 964.92 - 966.72: this too is they become some of the most 966.72 - 968.94: courageous soldiers uh because they know 968.94 - 970.50: what they're fighting for but there's 970.50 - 972.54: something more to it than that it's it 972.54 - 974.28: seems in their stories that there there 974.28 - 977.88: is a Humanity a human desire for freedom 977.88 - 981.12: and a human desire to improve oneself 981.12 - 983.70: even for those who have been denied even 983.70 - 985.62: the most basic rights for all of their 985.62 - 989.16: lives and I think that story should be 989.16 - 990.90: inspiring to all of us as a story of 990.90 - 992.22: Courage because we all deal with 992.22 - 994.62: difficulties but but none of us are 994.62 - 996.96: starting from slavery that's really 996.96 - 999.24: powerful that that that flame the 999.24 - 1000.62: Longing For Freedom can't be 1000.62 - 1002.90: extinguished through the generations of 1002.90 - 1004.22: slavery so that's something you talk 1004.22 - 1006.92: about there's some deep sense in which 1006.92 - 1009.80: uh while the war was about in part about 1009.80 - 1011.18: slavery 1011.18 - 1013.64: it's not 1013.64 - 1015.56: the slaves themselves 1015.56 - 1017.78: fought for their freedom and they won 1017.78 - 1019.46: their freedom I don't think it's a war 1019.46 - 1020.84: about slavery I think it's a war about 1020.84 - 1022.94: freedom because if you say it's a war 1022.94 - 1024.92: about slavery then it sounds like it's 1024.92 - 1027.38: an argument between the slave masters 1027.38 - 1030.62: and the other white guys who didn't want 1030.62 - 1032.06: slavery to exist and of course that 1032.06 - 1034.76: argument did exist but it wasn't it was 1034.76 - 1036.92: an argue it was a war over over Freedom 1036.92 - 1039.74: especially after 1863 into the second 1039.74 - 1042.08: year of the war when Lincoln because of 1042.08 - 1043.82: War pressures 1043.82 - 1047.06: uh signs Emancipation Proclamation which 1047.06 - 1049.16: therefore says that 1049.16 - 1050.96: um the Contraband the property of 1050.96 - 1054.44: Southerners I.E they're slaves will now 1054.44 - 1056.60: be freed and brought into the Union Army 1056.60 - 1058.82: that makes it about about Freedom 1058.82 - 1060.62: already the slaves were leaving the 1060.62 - 1062.72: plantations they knew what was going on 1062.72 - 1063.98: and they were going to get out of 1063.98 - 1066.20: slavery as soon as they could but now it 1066.20 - 1068.42: becomes a war over freeing them over 1068.42 - 1072.02: opening that opportunity for them uh and 1072.02 - 1073.22: and that's how the war ends that's 1073.22 - 1074.78: really important right and that's where 1074.78 - 1076.40: we are in our politics today it's the 1076.40 - 1077.96: same debate it's why I wrote this book 1077.96 - 1081.02: uh the challenge of our time is to 1081.02 - 1083.00: understand how do we make our society 1083.00 - 1085.94: open to more freedom for more people 1085.94 - 1088.82: so let's go to the beginning 1088.82 - 1091.76: how did the American Civil War start and 1091.76 - 1094.46: why so the American Civil War starts 1094.46 - 1097.52: because of our flawed institutions the 1097.52 - 1099.80: founders uh had mixed views of slavery 1099.80 - 1102.14: but they wanted a system that would 1102.14 - 1105.14: eventually work its way toward uh 1105.14 - 1107.24: opening for more people of more kinds 1107.24 - 1109.10: not necessarily equality but they wanted 1109.10 - 1111.68: a more open democratic system but our 1111.68 - 1113.78: institutions were designed in ways that 1113.78 - 1116.66: gave disproportionate power to slave 1116.66 - 1118.70: holders in particular states in the 1118.70 - 1121.28: union through the Senate through the 1121.28 - 1122.54: Electoral College through many of the 1122.54 - 1123.92: institutions we talk about in our 1123.92 - 1126.98: politics today therefore that part of 1126.98 - 1129.14: the country was in the words of Abraham 1129.14 - 1130.70: Lincoln holding the rest of the country 1130.70 - 1132.02: hostage 1132.02 - 1134.54: for a poor white man like Abraham 1134.54 - 1136.28: Lincoln born in Kentucky who makes his 1136.28 - 1139.10: way in Illinois slavery was an evil not 1139.10 - 1141.08: just for moral reasons it was an evil 1141.08 - 1142.94: because it denied him Democratic 1142.94 - 1144.02: opportunity 1144.02 - 1146.60: why would anyone hire poor Abe to do 1146.60 - 1148.04: something if they could get a slave to 1148.04 - 1149.30: do it for free 1149.30 - 1151.64: an economy of effort of opportunity for 1151.64 - 1153.26: him had to be an economy that was open 1153.26 - 1155.06: and that did not have slavery 1155.06 - 1156.50: particularly in the new states that were 1156.50 - 1157.94: coming into the Union 1157.94 - 1159.86: Lincoln was one of the creators of the 1159.86 - 1161.84: Republican party which was a party 1161.84 - 1163.88: dedicated to making sure all new 1163.88 - 1164.96: territory 1164.96 - 1168.14: was open to anyone who was willing to 1168.14 - 1170.36: work any male figure who would be paid 1170.36 - 1172.40: for their work Free Labor Free Soil free 1172.40 - 1174.74: men basic capitalism Southerners 1174.74 - 1176.24: southern plantation owners were an 1176.24 - 1179.66: aristocracy that did not want that they 1179.66 - 1181.46: wanted to use slavery and expand slavery 1181.46 - 1183.50: into the new territories what caused the 1183.50 - 1186.20: Civil War to clash and our institutions 1186.20 - 1189.02: that were unable to adapt and continue 1189.02 - 1191.78: to give disproportionate power 1191.78 - 1194.12: to these southern plantation slave 1194.12 - 1196.22: owners the Supreme Court was dominated 1196.22 - 1199.16: by them Senate was dominated by them and 1199.16 - 1200.78: so the Republican Party 1200.78 - 1204.20: came into power as a critique of that 1204.20 - 1207.02: and Southerners unwilling to accept 1207.02 - 1208.70: Southern Confederates unwilling to 1208.70 - 1210.32: accept that change 1210.32 - 1212.18: went to war with the Union 1212.18 - 1213.98: so who was on each side the union 1213.98 - 1215.36: Confederates 1215.36 - 1217.22: what are we talking about what are the 1217.22 - 1219.08: states how many people 1219.08 - 1223.58: uh what's like the the demographics and 1223.58 - 1226.52: the Dynamics of of each side the union 1226.52 - 1229.16: side is much much larger right in terms 1229.16 - 1230.78: of population I have about 22 million 1230.78 - 1233.66: people uh and it is what we would today 1233.66 - 1235.94: recognize as all the states uh basically 1235.94 - 1238.70: uh north of Virginia the south is the 1238.70 - 1241.34: states in the south of the Mason-Dixon 1241.34 - 1244.28: line so Virginia and there on South West 1244.28 - 1246.32: through Tennessee so Texas for example 1246.32 - 1248.18: is in the Confederacy Tennessee's in the 1248.18 - 1250.64: Confederacy uh but other states like 1250.64 - 1254.60: Missouri are border border states and 1254.60 - 1257.00: um the the Confederacy is a much smaller 1257.00 - 1259.52: entity uh it's made up of about nine 1259.52 - 1261.44: million people plus about 4 million 1261.44 - 1265.82: slaves and it is a agricultural economy 1265.82 - 1267.56: whereas the northern economy is a more 1267.56 - 1269.90: industrializing economy interestingly 1269.90 - 1271.58: enough the Confederate states are in 1271.58 - 1274.58: some ways more International than the 1274.58 - 1276.74: northern states because they are 1276.74 - 1279.68: exporters of cotton exporters of tobacco 1279.68 - 1281.78: so they actually have very strong 1281.78 - 1283.52: International economic ties very strong 1283.52 - 1285.44: ties to Great Britain the United States 1285.44 - 1287.24: was the largest source of cotton to the 1287.24 - 1289.04: world before the Civil War Egypt 1289.04 - 1290.84: replaces that a little bit during the 1290.84 - 1293.72: Civil War but all the English textiles 1293.72 - 1297.08: were American cotton from the south and 1297.08 - 1299.96: so uh it is the southern half of what we 1299.96 - 1301.40: would call the eastern part of the 1301.40 - 1302.96: United States today with far fewer 1302.96 - 1305.30: people it's made up the Confederacy is 1305.30 - 1308.36: of landed families wealth in the 1308.36 - 1311.66: Confederacy was land and slaves the 1311.66 - 1313.28: northern United States is made up 1313.28 - 1315.86: predominantly of small business owners 1315.86 - 1318.50: and then larger Financial interests such 1318.50 - 1321.34: as the banks in New York 1321.34 - 1324.02: and what about the military who are the 1324.02 - 1326.12: people that picked out guns what are the 1326.12 - 1328.16: numbers there so the the union also 1328.16 - 1330.02: outnumbered a Confederate by far but 1330.02 - 1331.40: it's a really interesting question 1331.40 - 1332.96: because there's no conscription in the 1332.96 - 1335.00: Constitution uh unlike most other 1335.00 - 1337.70: countries our democracy is formed on the 1337.70 - 1339.44: presumption that human beings should not 1339.44 - 1340.94: be forced to go into the military if 1340.94 - 1342.74: they don't want to most democracies in 1342.74 - 1344.48: the world today actually still require 1344.48 - 1346.28: military service the United States is 1346.28 - 1348.02: very rarely in its history done that 1348.02 - 1350.78: it's not in our constitution so 1350.78 - 1352.46: um during the Civil War in the first 1352.46 - 1354.02: months and years of the Civil War 1354.02 - 1357.44: Abraham Lincoln has to go to 1357.44 - 1359.36: um the different states to the governors 1359.36 - 1361.82: and ask the governors for volunteers 1361.82 - 1364.40: so the men who take up arms especially 1364.40 - 1366.50: in the first months of the war are 1366.50 - 1369.02: volunteers in the North in the South 1369.02 - 1370.88: they're actually conscripted 1370.88 - 1373.64: and then as the war goes on the union 1373.64 - 1376.76: will pass the conscription acts of 1862 1376.76 - 1379.04: and 1863 which for the first time and 1379.04 - 1380.00: this is really important because it 1380.00 - 1381.98: creates new presidential powers for the 1381.98 - 1383.78: first time Lincoln will have 1383.78 - 1386.30: Presidential Power to force men into the 1386.30 - 1388.46: army which is what leads to all kinds of 1388.46 - 1390.92: draft riots in New York and elsewhere 1390.92 - 1392.84: but suffice it to say the Union Army 1392.84 - 1395.00: throughout the war is often three times 1395.00 - 1398.00: the size of the Confederate Army what's 1398.00 - 1399.50: the relationship 1399.50 - 1402.80: between this uh no conscription and 1402.80 - 1405.16: people standing up to fight for ideas 1405.16 - 1407.78: and the Second Amendment a well 1407.78 - 1410.12: regulated militia being necessary to the 1410.12 - 1411.92: security of a free state the right of 1411.92 - 1414.08: the people to keep and bear arms shall 1414.08 - 1415.82: not be infringed 1415.82 - 1418.40: we're in Texas yeah yes so what's the 1418.40 - 1421.82: role of that uh in in this story the 1421.82 - 1423.68: American population is already armed 1423.68 - 1424.88: before the war 1424.88 - 1427.04: and so even though the union and the 1427.04 - 1429.14: Confederate armies will manufacture and 1429.14 - 1431.18: purchase arms it is already an armed 1431.18 - 1433.40: population so uh the American 1433.40 - 1435.68: presumption going into the war is that 1435.68 - 1438.08: citizens will not be forced to serve but 1438.08 - 1439.64: they will serve in militias to protect 1439.64 - 1441.38: their own property and so the Second 1441.38 - 1442.52: Amendment the key part of the Second 1442.52 - 1444.08: Amendment for me as a historian is the 1444.08 - 1445.94: well-regulated militia part the 1445.94 - 1448.46: presumption that citizens as part of 1448.46 - 1450.62: their civic duty do not have a duty to 1450.62 - 1454.22: join a national Army Prussian style but 1454.22 - 1456.02: are supposed to be involved in defending 1456.02 - 1457.34: their communities 1457.34 - 1459.56: uh and that's that's the reality it's 1459.56 - 1461.18: also a bit of a myth 1461.18 - 1463.52: um and so Americans have have throughout 1463.52 - 1465.32: their history been gun owners 1465.32 - 1468.50: not AK-47 owners but gun owners and gun 1468.50 - 1470.54: ownership has been for the purpose of 1470.54 - 1472.70: community self-defense the question 1472.70 - 1475.16: coming out of that is what does that 1475.16 - 1477.26: mean in terms of do you have access to 1477.26 - 1479.66: everything uh Antonin Scalia even 1479.66 - 1481.10: himself asked this question on the 1481.10 - 1483.92: Supreme Court you know he said in one of 1483.92 - 1486.44: the gun gun cases uh you have the right 1486.44 - 1488.12: to defend yourself but you don't have 1488.12 - 1490.22: the right to own an Uzi 1490.22 - 1491.72: yeah you don't have the right to have a 1491.72 - 1493.16: tank I don't think they'd let you park a 1493.16 - 1495.68: tank Lex in your parking spot right I 1495.68 - 1497.30: looked into this I think I think there's 1497.30 - 1500.60: a gray area around tanks actually I 1500.60 - 1503.30: think you're legit allowed to own a tank 1503.30 - 1505.58: oh you really I think that like somebody 1505.58 - 1507.86: look into somebody told me but I could 1507.86 - 1509.72: see like that because it's very 1509.72 - 1511.04: difficult for that to get out of hand 1511.04 - 1513.56: right right okay there may be one guy in 1513.56 - 1515.54: a tank that you could be breaking laws 1515.54 - 1517.76: in terms of the width of the vehicle 1517.76 - 1519.80: that you're using to operate 1519.80 - 1521.48: um anyway that's that's a hilarious 1521.48 - 1523.70: discussion but starting to make the case 1523.70 - 1526.10: speaking of AK-47s and rifles and back 1526.10 - 1528.02: to Ukraine for a second one of the 1528.02 - 1530.12: fascinating social experiments that 1530.12 - 1532.34: happened in Ukraine at the beginning of 1532.34 - 1535.04: the war is they handed out guns to 1535.04 - 1539.30: everybody rifles and crime went down 1539.30 - 1541.46: which I think is really interesting 1541.46 - 1542.84: yeah 1542.84 - 1545.06: I hope somebody does a kind of 1545.06 - 1548.06: psychological data collection analysis 1548.06 - 1549.80: effort here to try to understand why 1549.80 - 1553.46: because it's not obvious to me that in a 1553.46 - 1556.10: time of War if you give guns to the 1556.10 - 1557.78: entire populace anyone who wants a gun 1557.78 - 1560.18: it's not going to especially in a 1560.18 - 1561.80: country who has historically suffered 1561.80 - 1565.22: from corruption not result in robberies 1565.22 - 1566.60: and assaults and all that kind of stuff 1566.60 - 1568.52: there's a deep lesson there now I don't 1568.52 - 1569.84: know if you can extend that lesson 1569.84 - 1571.70: Beyond wartime though right that's the 1571.70 - 1573.26: question what happens after the war I 1573.26 - 1575.36: mean my inclination would be to say that 1575.36 - 1576.80: can work during war but you have to take 1576.80 - 1579.04: the guns back after the war 1579.04 - 1581.60: but they might be very upset when you 1581.60 - 1582.86: try that's the problem no that's 1582.86 - 1584.42: precisely the problem that that's 1584.42 - 1585.86: actually part of the story here I mean 1585.86 - 1587.66: what happens after the Civil War after 1587.66 - 1591.38: Appomattox in 1865 is that many uh 1591.38 - 1592.94: Southern soldiers go home with their 1592.94 - 1597.08: guns and they misuse their weapons uh to 1597.08 - 1600.86: quite frankly shoot and intimidate uh 1600.86 - 1602.48: former slaves who are now citizens this 1602.48 - 1603.86: is a big problem I talk about this in 1603.86 - 1606.86: the book in Memphis in 1866 it is former 1606.86 - 1609.32: Confederate soldiers and police officers 1609.32 - 1611.90: and judges who are responsible for 1611.90 - 1614.60: hundreds of rapes uh within a two-day 1614.60 - 1616.88: period and destroying an entire 1616.88 - 1618.92: community of African Americans and 1618.92 - 1620.36: they're able to do that because they 1620.36 - 1622.78: brought their guns home but underneath 1622.78 - 1625.40: underneath the issue of guns there is 1625.40 - 1628.06: just the fundamental issue of 1628.06 - 1633.02: hatred and inability to see uh other 1633.02 - 1635.66: humans in this in this world as having 1635.66 - 1638.90: equal value is another human being what 1638.90 - 1642.44: was the election of 1860 like that 1642.44 - 1644.78: brought Lincoln to power so the election 1644.78 - 1648.26: of 1860 uh was a very divisive election 1648.26 - 1651.20: we have divisive contested elections 1651.20 - 1655.28: from 1860 really until 1896. the 1860 1655.28 - 1658.16: election is the first election where a 1658.16 - 1660.02: republican is elected president that is 1660.02 - 1661.52: Lincoln but he's elected president with 1661.52 - 1663.50: less than 40 percent of the vote because 1663.50 - 1666.20: you have two sets of Democrats running 1666.20 - 1668.84: Democrats who are out to defend the 1668.84 - 1670.64: Confederacy and everything and then 1670.64 - 1672.92: Democrats who want to compromise but 1672.92 - 1674.84: still keep saying slavery uh most famous 1674.84 - 1678.32: Stephen Douglas who argues for 1678.32 - 1680.00: um basically allowing each state to make 1680.00 - 1681.92: its own decisions popular sovereignty as 1681.92 - 1683.66: he called it um and then you still have 1683.66 - 1684.98: traditional Whigs who are running that 1684.98 - 1686.78: was the party that preceded uh the 1686.78 - 1688.04: Republican party so you're four 1688.04 - 1690.14: candidates Lincoln wins a plurality 1690.14 - 1692.78: Lincoln is elected largely because uh 1692.78 - 1695.26: the states that are anti-slavery or 1695.26 - 1697.76: anti-expansion of slavery are not a 1697.76 - 1700.22: majority but they're a plurality and the 1700.22 - 1702.62: other states have basically uh 1702.62 - 1704.60: factionalized and so they're unable to 1704.60 - 1707.30: have a united front against him was the 1707.30 - 1710.12: main topic a hand slavery I think the 1710.12 - 1712.82: main topic at hand at that time was the 1712.82 - 1715.04: expansion of slavery into new 1715.04 - 1716.60: territories into new territory right it 1716.60 - 1718.04: was not whether to abolish slavery or 1718.04 - 1719.54: not Lincoln is very careful and its 1719.54 - 1722.36: correspondence is clear he wants no one 1722.36 - 1724.10: on his side during the election to say 1724.10 - 1726.32: that he's arguing for abolitionism even 1726.32 - 1728.60: though he personally supported that what 1728.60 - 1730.46: he wants to say is the Republican party 1730.46 - 1734.78: is for no new slave territories did he 1734.78 - 1736.16: make it clear 1736.16 - 1739.46: that he was for abolition no he was 1739.46 - 1742.52: intentionally unclear about that 1742.52 - 1745.64: what do you think he was throughout his 1745.64 - 1748.22: life was there a deep 1748.22 - 1750.20: because that takes quite a vision like 1750.20 - 1752.18: you look at society today 1752.18 - 1755.90: and you it takes quite a man 1755.90 - 1758.96: to see that there's something deeply 1758.96 - 1760.46: broken where a lot of people take for 1760.46 - 1762.68: granted I mean in modern day you could 1762.68 - 1764.24: see factory farming 1764.24 - 1766.04: is one of those things that in a hundred 1766.04 - 1768.26: years we might see is like the torture 1768.26 - 1769.88: of the mass torture of animals could be 1769.88 - 1772.70: uh could be seen as evil but just to 1772.70 - 1774.32: look around and wake up to that 1774.32 - 1776.54: especially in a leadership position uh 1776.54 - 1778.64: yeah was he able to see that in some 1778.64 - 1780.08: ways yes in some ways no I mean the 1780.08 - 1781.58: premise of your question is really 1781.58 - 1783.20: important that 1783.20 - 1785.42: um to us it's obvious that slavery is is 1785.42 - 1788.00: a horror but to those who had grown up 1788.00 - 1790.64: with it who had grown up seeing that it 1790.64 - 1792.62: was hard to imagine a different world so 1792.62 - 1795.14: you're right Lincoln's imagination like 1795.14 - 1797.14: everyone else's was limited by his time 1797.14 - 1799.64: I don't think Lincoln imagined a world 1799.64 - 1802.16: of equality between the races but he had 1802.16 - 1805.40: come to see that slavery uh was horrible 1805.40 - 1807.50: and historians have differed in in how 1807.50 - 1811.88: he came to this uh part of it is that uh 1811.88 - 1813.50: he had a father who treated him like a 1813.50 - 1814.34: slave 1814.34 - 1816.02: and you can see in his early 1816.02 - 1817.82: correspondence how much he hates that 1817.82 - 1819.44: his father who is a struggling farmer 1819.44 - 1821.18: was basically trying to control 1821.18 - 1822.56: Lincoln's life 1822.56 - 1825.80: and he came to understand personally I 1825.80 - 1827.24: think how horrible it is to have someone 1827.24 - 1828.56: else tell you what you should do with 1828.56 - 1831.38: your labor not giving you your own your 1831.38 - 1833.84: own choices but Lincoln was also a 1833.84 - 1835.34: pragmatist this is what made him a great 1835.34 - 1837.26: politician he wanted to work through 1837.26 - 1839.54: institutions not to burn them down 1839.54 - 1843.56: and he famously said that uh if he could 1843.56 - 1846.26: preserve the union and stop the spread 1846.26 - 1848.36: of slavery by allowing slavery to stay 1848.36 - 1850.04: in the South he would if he could do it 1850.04 - 1851.48: by eliminating slavery in the South he 1851.48 - 1852.74: would if he could do it by buying the 1852.74 - 1854.30: slaves and sending them somewhere else 1854.30 - 1857.66: he would his main goal what he ran on 1857.66 - 1859.82: was that the new territories west of 1859.82 - 1861.92: Illinois that they would be areas for 1861.92 - 1867.98: free poor white men like him not slavery 1867.98 - 1869.90: what do you learn about human nature if 1869.90 - 1871.22: you step back and look at the big 1871.22 - 1873.32: picture of it that slavey has been a 1873.32 - 1875.12: part of human civilization for thousands 1875.12 - 1878.60: of years that this American slavery is 1878.60 - 1881.54: not a new phenomenon 1881.54 - 1883.28: I think history teaches us a very 1883.28 - 1885.32: pessimistic and a very optimistic lesson 1885.32 - 1887.18: the pessimistic lesson is that human 1887.18 - 1889.52: beings are capable of doing enormous 1889.52 - 1892.64: harm and brutality to their fellow man 1892.64 - 1895.16: and woman and we see that with genocide 1895.16 - 1896.42: in our world today 1896.42 - 1898.94: dead human beings are capable with the 1898.94 - 1902.96: right stimuli the right incentives 1902.96 - 1906.50: of of enslaving others I mean genocide 1906.50 - 1909.02: is in the same category right 1909.02 - 1911.84: uh the optimistic side 1911.84 - 1913.64: is that human beings are also capable 1913.64 - 1916.70: with proper leadership and governance of 1916.70 - 1918.44: resisting those urges 1918.44 - 1920.78: of putting those energies into 1920.78 - 1923.48: productive uses for other people but I 1923.48 - 1925.70: don't think that comes naturally I think 1925.70 - 1927.38: that's where leadership and institutions 1927.38 - 1929.42: matter but leadership and institutions 1929.42 - 1932.18: can tame us we contain we can civilize 1932.18 - 1934.28: ourselves you know for a long time we 1934.28 - 1936.50: stopped using that verb to civilize I 1936.50 - 1938.30: believe in Civilization I believe 1938.30 - 1940.64: there's a civilizing role Lincoln spoke 1940.64 - 1942.44: of that right so did Franklin Roosevelt 1942.44 - 1944.36: the civilizing role that government 1944.36 - 1946.10: plays education is only a part of that 1946.10 - 1948.68: it's creating laws minimal laws but laws 1948.68 - 1951.02: nonetheless that incentivize and 1951.02 - 1953.78: penalize us for going to the dark side 1953.78 - 1955.94: but if we allow that to happen or we 1955.94 - 1957.74: have leaders who encourage us to go to 1957.74 - 1960.32: the dark side we can very quickly go 1960.32 - 1963.74: down a deep dark tunnel see I believe 1963.74 - 1967.16: that most people want to do good and the 1967.16 - 1970.66: power of Institutions if done well 1970.66 - 1973.16: they encourage and protect you if you 1973.16 - 1974.36: want to do good 1974.36 - 1977.36: so if you're just in the jungle 1977.36 - 1979.82: the so from a game theoretic perspective 1979.82 - 1982.76: you get punished for for doing good 1982.76 - 1985.82: so being extremely self-centered and 1985.82 - 1987.98: greedy and even violent and manipulative 1987.98 - 1990.38: can have from a game theory perspective 1990.38 - 1992.42: uh benefits but I don't think that's 1992.42 - 1995.30: what most humans want institutions allow 1995.30 - 1996.86: you to do what you actually want which 1996.86 - 1999.08: is to do good for the world do good for 1999.08 - 2002.14: others and actually in so doing do good 2002.14 - 2003.10: for yourself 2003.10 - 2005.68: institutions protect that natural human 2005.68 - 2007.72: instinct I think and what you just 2007.72 - 2009.64: articulated which I think the historical 2009.64 - 2011.80: record is very strong on is the classic 2011.80 - 2014.20: liberal position that's what liberalism 2014.20 - 2016.96: means in a 19th century sense right that 2016.96 - 2019.00: you believe in civilizing human beings 2019.00 - 2021.22: through institutions that begins with 2021.22 - 2024.18: education kindergarten is an institution 2024.18 - 2029.26: laws uh and and just basic habits that 2029.26 - 2033.16: are enforced by Society 2033.16 - 2034.54: how do you think people thought about 2034.54 - 2036.16: the idea 2036.16 - 2038.44: how do they Square the idea of all men 2038.44 - 2040.42: are created equal those very powerful 2040.42 - 2043.74: words uh at the founding of this nation 2043.74 - 2047.14: how do they square that with slavery 2047.14 - 2049.48: for many Americans saying all men were 2049.48 - 2051.82: created equal required slavery because 2051.82 - 2054.28: it meant that uh the equality of white 2054.28 - 2056.56: people was dependent upon others doing 2056.56 - 2058.86: the work for us in the way some people 2058.86 - 2062.44: View Animal labor today and maybe in 50 2062.44 - 2065.50: years we'll see that as a contradiction 2065.50 - 2068.68: but the notion among many Americans in 2068.68 - 2070.30: the 17th 18th century and this would 2070.30 - 2071.32: also be true for those in other 2071.32 - 2074.68: societies was that equality for white 2074.68 - 2075.64: men 2075.64 - 2078.52: meant that you had access to the labor 2078.52 - 2080.44: of others that would allow you to 2080.44 - 2082.54: equalize other differences 2082.54 - 2086.74: so uh you could produce enough food so 2086.74 - 2088.84: your family could live equally well 2088.84 - 2091.00: nourished as other families because you 2091.00 - 2093.46: had slaves on the land doing the farming 2093.46 - 2095.68: for you this is Thomas Jefferson's world 2095.68 - 2098.74: so it's like animal farm all animals are 2098.74 - 2100.12: equal but some are more equal than 2100.12 - 2102.10: others that's right and I think that's 2102.10 - 2103.60: that's still the way people view things 2103.60 - 2106.66: yeah right I don't know if that's a 2106.66 - 2108.34: that's a liberal position or it's just a 2108.34 - 2110.38: human position that um 2110.38 - 2113.56: that all humans have equal value 2113.56 - 2116.08: just on the basic level of like of 2116.08 - 2117.22: humanity 2117.22 - 2119.68: but do we really believe that I we want 2119.68 - 2121.48: to I don't know ourselves I don't know 2121.48 - 2123.52: if our society really believes that yet 2123.52 - 2125.38: and I don't know exactly I mean it's 2125.38 - 2127.78: super complicated of course 2127.78 - 2129.76: um when you realize the amount of 2129.76 - 2131.20: suffering that's going on in the world 2131.20 - 2133.42: where there's children dying from 2133.42 - 2136.24: starvation in Africa and to say that all 2136.24 - 2138.46: humans are equal well a few dollars can 2138.46 - 2141.46: save that life and and instead we buy a 2141.46 - 2144.04: Starbucks coffee and we are willing to 2144.04 - 2147.76: pay 10 50 100 000 to save a child our 2147.76 - 2149.74: child like uh somebody from our family 2149.74 - 2152.38: and don't want to spend two dollars to 2152.38 - 2154.78: save a child over in Africa right so 2154.78 - 2157.06: there's and uh I think Sam Harris or 2157.06 - 2158.98: others have talked about like well I 2158.98 - 2160.18: want I don't want to live in a world 2160.18 - 2164.26: where we'd rather send two dollars to 2164.26 - 2166.30: Africa there's something deeply human 2166.30 - 2168.28: about saving those that are really close 2168.28 - 2170.44: to you the ones we love so that like 2170.44 - 2171.88: hypocrisy 2171.88 - 2174.40: that seems to go attention with the 2174.40 - 2176.92: basic ethics of alleviating suffering in 2176.92 - 2178.60: the world that's also really human 2178.60 - 2181.72: that's also part of this ideal 2181.72 - 2184.24: of all men are created equal it's a 2184.24 - 2186.34: complicated messy World ethically it it 2186.34 - 2188.74: is but I mean I think at least the way I 2188.74 - 2191.62: think about it is so what are the things 2191.62 - 2193.90: even within our own Society 2193.90 - 2196.48: where we choose to do something with our 2196.48 - 2199.06: resources that actually doesn't help the 2199.06 - 2201.70: lives of many people so we we invest in 2201.70 - 2203.74: all kinds of things that are often 2203.74 - 2205.48: because someone is lobbying for them 2205.48 - 2206.98: this happens on both sides of the aisle 2206.98 - 2208.54: this is not a political statement right 2208.54 - 2210.46: rather than saying you know if we 2210.46 - 2212.74: invested a little more of our money 2212.74 - 2214.18: really a little more we can make sure 2214.18 - 2215.80: every child in this country had decent 2215.80 - 2217.06: Health Care 2217.06 - 2218.68: we can make sure every child in this 2218.68 - 2221.32: country had what they need needed to 2221.32 - 2222.82: start life healthy 2222.82 - 2224.80: and that would not require us to 2224.80 - 2226.24: sacrifice a lot but it would require us 2226.24 - 2229.00: to sacrifice a few things 2229.00 - 2231.46: yeah there's a balance there and I also 2231.46 - 2233.74: noticed the passive aggressive statement 2233.74 - 2235.60: you're making about how I'm spending my 2235.60 - 2238.54: money you know me too spending it a 2238.54 - 2239.94: little more wisely 2239.94 - 2243.16: I I you know I like to eat nice meals at 2243.16 - 2245.26: nice restaurants uh so I'm I'm as guilty 2245.26 - 2246.60: of this as you are 2246.60 - 2249.52: I got a couch and that couch serves no 2249.52 - 2251.14: purpose it looks nice though no it's so 2251.14 - 2253.36: nice it's a nice looking cow so it's 2253.36 - 2254.62: actually very clean I got it for 2254.62 - 2256.30: occasional Instagram photos to look like 2256.30 - 2258.16: an adult okay 2258.16 - 2260.32: because everything else in my life is a 2260.32 - 2262.72: giant mess 2262.72 - 2264.94: what role did the ideas of the founding 2264.94 - 2267.76: documents of this country play in this 2267.76 - 2270.28: war the war between the union and the 2270.28 - 2271.78: Confederate States 2271.78 - 2274.06: and the founding ideas that were 2274.06 - 2275.50: supposed to be unifying to this country 2275.50 - 2277.18: is there is there interesting tensions 2277.18 - 2278.86: there well there were certainly tensions 2278.86 - 2280.60: because built into the founding 2280.60 - 2282.82: documents of course is slavery and 2282.82 - 2285.04: inequality and women's exclusion from 2285.04 - 2287.38: voting and things of that sort uh but 2287.38 - 2289.84: the real Brilliance of Abraham Lincoln 2289.84 - 2291.94: is to build on the Brilliance of the 2291.94 - 2294.16: founders and turn the union position 2294.16 - 2296.74: into this into the defense of the core 2296.74 - 2299.68: ideas of the country so the Confederacy 2299.68 - 2301.90: is defending one idea the idea of 2301.90 - 2302.98: slavery 2302.98 - 2305.80: Lincoln takes the basket of all the 2305.80 - 2307.60: deeper ideas and puts them together 2307.60 - 2309.76: three things the war is about for 2309.76 - 2311.20: Lincoln and this is why his speeches 2311.20 - 2312.76: still resonate with us today you know 2312.76 - 2314.32: every time I'm in Washington I go to the 2314.32 - 2315.52: Lincoln Memorial 2315.52 - 2317.74: it's the best Memorial the best Monument 2317.74 - 2320.80: I think in the world actually and 2320.80 - 2323.02: um there are always people there 2323.02 - 2326.14: reading Gettysburg address and the 2326.14 - 2328.42: second inaugural Lincoln had two years 2328.42 - 2330.28: of education yet he found the words to 2330.28 - 2331.48: describe what our country was about 2331.48 - 2332.74: better than anyone and it's because he 2332.74 - 2335.02: went back to these founding values three 2335.02 - 2336.22: values we already talked about one 2336.22 - 2337.84: freedom 2337.84 - 2340.12: that uh and freedom is is actually 2340.12 - 2342.22: complex but it's also simple 2342.22 - 2345.16: uh the simple Lincoln definition is that 2345.16 - 2347.38: freedom is the right of each person to 2347.38 - 2348.82: work for himself 2348.82 - 2350.98: or herself which is to say it doesn't 2350.98 - 2352.30: mean you own your own company but it 2352.30 - 2353.92: means you control your labor 2353.92 - 2356.26: and no one can tell you you have to work 2356.26 - 2357.64: for a certain wage 2357.64 - 2359.46: you might not have a job but you decide 2359.46 - 2361.72: you decide right you can see where that 2361.72 - 2363.70: comes from his own background as a poor 2363.70 - 2365.68: man right so freedom is control of your 2365.68 - 2366.82: own labor 2366.82 - 2369.52: second democracy government of the 2369.52 - 2371.50: People by the people for the people the 2371.50 - 2372.76: government is to serve the peoples to 2372.76 - 2374.56: come from the people 2374.56 - 2377.08: and then the third Point Justice and 2377.08 - 2379.36: helping all human beings 2379.36 - 2381.82: he at the end of his life as the Civil 2381.82 - 2384.52: War is ending he never declares that the 2384.52 - 2387.22: South should be punished his argument is 2387.22 - 2389.32: that we shouldn't apologize for their 2389.32 - 2392.08: misdeeds but that all should be part of 2392.08 - 2393.40: this future he's not arguing for 2393.40 - 2395.68: consensus he's arguing for a society 2395.68 - 2398.44: where everyone has a stake going forward 2398.44 - 2401.50: so Justice democracy Freedom those are 2401.50 - 2404.08: those those are the gifts I talked about 2404.08 - 2406.00: the flaws in our system those are the 2406.00 - 2407.86: the virtues in our system that our 2407.86 - 2409.74: Founders coming out of the Enlightenment 2409.74 - 2412.00: planted and and Lincoln carries them 2412.00 - 2414.40: forward he gives us the 2.0 version of 2414.40 - 2415.24: them 2415.24 - 2418.54: so a few uh tangent questions about each 2418.54 - 2421.72: of those so one on democracy 2421.72 - 2423.10: um people often bring up the United 2423.10 - 2426.52: States as a democracy it's a republic 2426.52 - 2428.14: um that it's representative is there 2428.14 - 2429.64: some interesting tensions there in 2429.64 - 2431.86: terminology or is 2431.86 - 2434.38: um yeah can you maybe kind of expand on 2434.38 - 2436.84: the different versions of democracy 2436.84 - 2438.88: um so the philosophy of democracy but 2438.88 - 2440.50: also the Practical implementations of it 2440.50 - 2443.14: sure the founders intended for us to be 2443.14 - 2444.64: a democracy this argument that they 2444.64 - 2446.20: wanted us to be a republican sort of a 2446.20 - 2449.14: democracy is one of these made up myths 2449.14 - 2451.60: um they believed that fundamentally what 2451.60 - 2454.18: they were creating was a society very 2454.18 - 2456.52: few of which had existed before a 2456.52 - 2458.56: society where the government would be of 2458.56 - 2460.00: the People by the people for the people 2460.00 - 2461.68: that's what they expected right that's 2461.68 - 2463.96: what I meant so the legitimacy of our 2463.96 - 2465.28: government was not going to be that the 2465.28 - 2467.38: person in charge was of Royal Blood 2467.38 - 2469.60: that's the way the Europeans did it or 2469.60 - 2471.94: did the person in charge had killed 2471.94 - 2474.82: enough people Allah gang is gone or that 2474.82 - 2477.22: the person in charge uh was serving a 2477.22 - 2479.02: particular class it was that the person 2479.02 - 2480.88: in charge the institutions were to serve 2480.88 - 2484.18: Serve the People they adopted Republican 2484.18 - 2485.98: tools to get there 2485.98 - 2489.40: because they were fearful appropriately 2489.40 - 2492.46: of Simply throwing every issue up to the 2492.46 - 2495.70: masses democracy is not mob rule 2495.70 - 2498.12: democracy is where you create procedures 2498.12 - 2501.40: to assess the public will 2501.40 - 2503.56: and to act in ways that serve the public 2503.56 - 2506.38: without harming other elements of the 2506.38 - 2507.70: public that are not in the majority 2507.70 - 2509.68: that's why we have a constitution and a 2509.68 - 2511.60: Bill of Rights and at that for their 2511.60 - 2513.34: time the founders did not believe that 2513.34 - 2515.20: women should be part of this discussion 2515.20 - 2517.12: that they were not capable they were 2517.12 - 2518.62: wrong about that in their time that's 2518.62 - 2520.36: how they thought we've of course changed 2520.36 - 2521.98: that they believed you had to have 2521.98 - 2524.62: property to have a stake we don't 2524.62 - 2526.54: believe that anymore so we can argue 2526.54 - 2528.94: over the details and and those 50 years 2528.94 - 2530.86: from now will criticize us right for the 2530.86 - 2533.08: way we think about these things but it 2533.08 - 2535.12: was fundamentally about this is the 2535.12 - 2537.52: radicalism of the American experiment 2537.52 - 2539.98: that government should Serve the People 2539.98 - 2543.04: all people so democracy means of the 2543.04 - 2545.02: People by the people for the people and 2545.02 - 2547.24: then it doesn't actually 2547.24 - 2549.28: give any details of how you implement 2549.28 - 2550.78: that because you could Implement all 2550.78 - 2552.10: kinds of voice and I think what we've 2552.10 - 2553.42: learned as historians I think what the 2553.42 - 2554.62: founders knew because they were very 2554.62 - 2556.12: well read in the history of Rome and 2556.12 - 2558.10: Greece was that democracy will always 2558.10 - 2559.78: have unique characteristics for the 2559.78 - 2561.76: culture that it's in 2561.76 - 2562.42: um 2562.42 - 2564.28: if coming out of the war against Russia 2564.28 - 2566.02: Ukraine is able to build a better 2566.02 - 2568.12: democracy than it had before it's never 2568.12 - 2570.16: going to look like the United States 2570.16 - 2571.72: is I'm not saying it's gonna be worse or 2571.72 - 2574.30: better a culture matters the particular 2574.30 - 2577.60: history of societies uh matters uh Japan 2577.60 - 2580.00: is a vibrant democracy I've been there 2580.00 - 2582.34: many times uh it it does not look at all 2582.34 - 2585.04: like the American democracy so so 2585.04 - 2588.04: democracy is a set of values the 2588.04 - 2590.14: implementation of those values is a set 2590.14 - 2592.12: of practical institutional decisions one 2592.12 - 2594.70: makes based in one's cultural position 2594.70 - 2597.16: so just the link on that topic is there 2597.16 - 2599.50: if you do representative you said like 2599.50 - 2602.32: you know democracy should not one 2602.32 - 2605.80: failure mode is Mob rule 2605.80 - 2607.84: so you should not descend into that not 2607.84 - 2609.10: every issue should be up to everybody 2609.10 - 2610.54: correct okay so you have a 2610.54 - 2614.14: representation but you know uh 2614.14 - 2615.70: Stalin 2615.70 - 2618.70: similarly felt that he could represent 2618.70 - 2621.16: the interests of the public he was also 2621.16 - 2623.38: helping represent the interests of the 2623.38 - 2626.38: public so that's a failure mode too the 2626.38 - 2628.24: if if the people representing the public 2628.24 - 2630.58: become more and more powerful they start 2630.58 - 2633.46: becoming detached from uh from actually 2633.46 - 2635.80: being able to represent or having just a 2635.80 - 2637.24: basic human sense of what the public 2637.24 - 2640.06: wants I I think being of the People by 2640.06 - 2641.98: the people for the people means you are 2641.98 - 2643.72: in some way accountable to the people 2643.72 - 2645.64: and the problem with the Communist Party 2645.64 - 2647.68: of the Soviet Union this was already 2647.68 - 2650.56: evident before Stalin came into power is 2650.56 - 2652.18: the same problem the Communist Party of 2652.18 - 2654.16: China has today which is that you have 2654.16 - 2657.76: leadership that's non-accountable 2657.76 - 2660.58: well let me go then to one of the other 2660.58 - 2662.50: three principles of freedom because one 2662.50 - 2663.40: of the ways to keep government 2663.40 - 2666.16: accountable is the freedom of the press 2666.16 - 2668.26: so there's a the internet and on the 2668.26 - 2670.18: internet there's social networks and one 2670.18 - 2671.92: of them is called Twitter I think you 2671.92 - 2673.12: have an account there people should 2673.12 - 2675.52: follow you and uh you know recently 2675.52 - 2676.96: people have been throwing around 2676.96 - 2679.24: recently for a while the words of 2679.24 - 2682.42: freedom of speech uh just out of 2682.42 - 2685.06: curiosity uh for tangent upon a tangent 2685.06 - 2687.46: uh what do you think of freedom of 2687.46 - 2690.22: speech as it is today and as it was at 2690.22 - 2691.96: that time during the Civil War after the 2691.96 - 2693.58: Civil War throughout the history of of 2693.58 - 2696.22: America so freedom of speech has always 2696.22 - 2698.14: been one of the core tenets of American 2698.14 - 2701.44: democracy and I'm near absolutist on it 2701.44 - 2703.96: uh because I I think that people should 2703.96 - 2706.30: have the right to speak uh what what 2706.30 - 2709.60: makes our democracy function is that 2709.60 - 2712.12: there is always room for quite frankly 2712.12 - 2715.48: people like you and me who uh like to 2715.48 - 2718.84: disagree and have reasons to disagree so 2718.84 - 2720.76: I am against almost all forms of 2720.76 - 2722.62: censorship the only time I believe in 2722.62 - 2725.86: censorship is if somehow an individual 2725.86 - 2728.38: or a new newspaper has stolen the 2728.38 - 2730.42: Ukrainian plans for their next military 2730.42 - 2732.64: movements in the next week you should 2732.64 - 2734.86: not be able to publish that right now 2734.86 - 2737.14: maybe after they act but criticism 2737.14 - 2740.26: opinion interpretation should be wide 2740.26 - 2745.06: open now that doesn't mean though that 2745.06 - 2747.52: um you have the right to come to my 2747.52 - 2750.28: classroom and start shouting and saying 2750.28 - 2751.84: whatever you want yeah you have the 2751.84 - 2753.94: right on the street corner to do that 2753.94 - 2756.82: but my classroom is a classroom for my 2756.82 - 2758.80: students with a particular purpose sorry 2758.80 - 2760.54: about that from last week I'll never do 2760.54 - 2762.06: it again 2762.06 - 2764.92: I'm really sorry it's okay it never 2764.92 - 2767.56: happened you know we get drunk so the 2767.56 - 2768.46: people who don't know your your 2768.46 - 2770.68: professor UT Austin is just it's nearby 2770.68 - 2772.84: so sometimes I I get a little drunk and 2772.84 - 2774.70: wander in there I'm not the only one is 2774.70 - 2775.90: that you I didn't even know it was you 2775.90 - 2778.18: okay 2778.18 - 2781.18: um so the point is that free speech is 2781.18 - 2783.94: not licensed to invade someone else's 2783.94 - 2785.86: space and and I also believe in private 2785.86 - 2788.74: Enterprise so I think that um 2788.74 - 2791.56: you know if if if I owned a social media 2791.56 - 2793.00: Network I don't 2793.00 - 2795.94: it would be up to me to decide 2795.94 - 2797.80: who gets to speak on that Network and 2797.80 - 2799.72: who doesn't and then people could decide 2799.72 - 2800.98: not to use it 2800.98 - 2803.14: if they don't want to use it but there's 2803.14 - 2804.70: uh so yes that's one of the founding 2804.70 - 2806.74: principles so oftentimes when you talk 2806.74 - 2808.78: about censorship that's government uh 2808.78 - 2811.66: censorship so social media if you run a 2811.66 - 2813.46: social media company you should be able 2813.46 - 2815.50: to decide from a technical perspective 2815.50 - 2817.30: of what freedom of speech means but 2817.30 - 2818.56: there's some deeper ethical 2818.56 - 2820.18: philosophical 2820.18 - 2821.88: sense of 2821.88 - 2824.80: how do you create a world where 2824.80 - 2827.02: every voice is heard of the People by 2827.02 - 2829.72: the people for the people that's not a 2829.72 - 2831.52: that's a complicated technical problem 2831.52 - 2833.98: when you have a Public Square how do you 2833.98 - 2835.66: have a productive conversation where 2835.66 - 2837.58: critics aren't silenced but the same 2837.58 - 2839.92: time Whoever has the bigger megaphone is 2839.92 - 2842.38: not going to crowd out everybody else so 2842.38 - 2845.38: I think it's very important to uh create 2845.38 - 2847.24: rules of the game that'll give everyone 2847.24 - 2851.38: a chance to get started and that allow 2851.38 - 2854.32: for guideposts to be created from the 2854.32 - 2856.32: will of the community which is to say 2856.32 - 2859.90: that we as a community can say We Can't 2859.90 - 2862.24: Stop people from speaking but we as a 2862.24 - 2864.22: community can say that in certain forms 2864.22 - 2866.62: we're going to create certain rules for 2866.62 - 2868.18: who gets to speak and who doesn't under 2868.18 - 2870.10: what terms but they can still have 2870.10 - 2872.32: somewhere else to go so I'm I believe in 2872.32 - 2874.84: Opening space for everyone but creating 2874.84 - 2877.96: certain spaces within those spaces that 2877.96 - 2879.64: are designed for certain purposes that's 2879.64 - 2883.00: what a school does so I will not bring 2883.00 - 2885.40: someone to speak to my students who is 2885.40 - 2887.62: unqualified it's not a political 2887.62 - 2890.02: judgment the rules at a university are 2890.02 - 2891.58: where an educational institution you 2891.58 - 2893.08: need to have the educational credentials 2893.08 - 2894.28: to come speak about artificial 2894.28 - 2896.02: intelligence I'm not going to bring some 2896.02 - 2899.14: bum off the street to do that right we 2899.14 - 2900.52: have certain rules but that bomb on the 2900.52 - 2902.80: street can still in his own space or her 2902.80 - 2904.30: own space can still say what he or she 2904.30 - 2905.38: wants to say about artificial 2905.38 - 2907.30: intelligence this is how newspapers work 2907.30 - 2909.34: when I write for the New York Times They 2909.34 - 2912.34: have an editorial team the editorial 2912.34 - 2914.44: team make certain decisions they check 2914.44 - 2917.08: facts and there's certain points of view 2917.08 - 2919.96: they don't allow anti-submitted comments 2919.96 - 2921.46: right you're not going to be able to 2921.46 - 2923.50: publish an anti-semitic screed whether 2923.50 - 2925.78: you think it's true or not true in the 2925.78 - 2927.40: New York Times but that doesn't prevent 2927.40 - 2929.62: you from finding somewhere else so we 2929.62 - 2931.90: allow entities to create certain rules 2931.90 - 2934.06: of the game we trans we make transparent 2934.06 - 2936.10: what those rules are and then we as 2936.10 - 2937.60: Citizens know where to go to get our 2937.60 - 2939.28: information what's what's been a problem 2939.28 - 2940.96: the last few decades I think is it 2940.96 - 2943.18: hasn't been clear what the rules are in 2943.18 - 2944.62: different places and what are the 2944.62 - 2946.42: legitimate places to get information and 2946.42 - 2948.46: what are not yeah the transparency seems 2948.46 - 2949.90: to be very critical there even from the 2949.90 - 2951.88: New York Times I think there's a lot of 2951.88 - 2955.06: skepticism about which way the editorial 2955.06 - 2957.46: processes lean I mean there's a public 2957.46 - 2959.62: perception that it's especially for 2959.62 - 2961.24: opinions it's going to be very 2961.24 - 2964.06: left-leaning in the New York Times and 2964.06 - 2966.04: without transparency 2966.04 - 2968.14: about what the process is like about the 2968.14 - 2970.36: people involved you all you do like 2970.36 - 2972.76: conspiracy theories and and the general 2972.76 - 2974.92: public opinion about that is going to go 2974.92 - 2976.24: go wild 2976.24 - 2978.82: and uh I think that's okay for the New 2978.82 - 2980.74: York Times people can in a collective 2980.74 - 2983.08: way figure stuff out like they could say 2983.08 - 2987.22: okay New York Times uh 73 of the time is 2987.22 - 2989.14: gonna lean left in their head they have 2989.14 - 2991.66: like a loose estimation or whatever uh 2991.66 - 2994.24: but for a platform like Twitter it seems 2994.24 - 2997.18: like they're it's more complicated now 2997.18 - 2998.38: of course there should be rules of the 2998.38 - 3000.54: game but I think there's um 3000.54 - 3003.18: maybe I want to say a responsibility to 3003.18 - 3007.02: also create incentives for people to do 3007.02 - 3010.08: High effort empathetic debate 3010.08 - 3013.02: versus throwing poop at each other yeah 3013.02 - 3014.88: I think those are two slightly different 3014.88 - 3016.38: things so I agree 3016.38 - 3019.20: I think that my view is that the failure 3019.20 - 3020.94: of Facebook and Twitter and others and 3020.94 - 3023.46: in recent years has been that they have 3023.46 - 3025.32: been completely untransparent about 3025.32 - 3028.20: their rules so what I would think would 3028.20 - 3029.82: make would Advance us 3029.82 - 3032.46: is if they had a set of rules that were 3032.46 - 3034.20: clear that were consistently followed 3034.20 - 3036.60: and we understood what they were 3036.60 - 3039.48: that would also tell us as consumers 3039.48 - 3042.36: how much what the biases are how to 3042.36 - 3043.92: understand what's going on it seems like 3043.92 - 3045.54: I might say that since Elon Musk is 3045.54 - 3047.10: taken over Twitter it's been arbitrary 3047.10 - 3048.42: and who's thrown off and who's not 3048.42 - 3050.46: thrown off who's and that's that's a 3050.46 - 3052.32: real problem arbitrariness is in some 3052.32 - 3054.54: ways the opposite of democracy but 3054.54 - 3057.72: there's also a hidden arbitrariness 3057.72 - 3059.40: in uh 3059.40 - 3061.44: interpretation of the rules so for 3061.44 - 3062.46: example 3062.46 - 3065.52: what comment incites violence 3065.52 - 3067.26: that's really really difficult to figure 3067.26 - 3068.78: out to me like there's a gray area 3068.78 - 3071.46: obviously there's very clear versions of 3071.46 - 3074.04: that but if I know anything about people 3074.04 - 3076.14: that try to incite violence they're 3076.14 - 3078.24: usually not coming out and clearly 3078.24 - 3080.46: saying it they're usually kind of dog 3080.46 - 3082.44: whistling it and same with racism and 3082.44 - 3084.12: anti-Semitism all of that it's usually 3084.12 - 3087.60: dog whistles so like and they usually 3087.60 - 3089.40: I have fun playing with the rules 3089.40 - 3091.44: playing around the rules so it's a it's 3091.44 - 3093.72: a gray area same with uh June covet 3093.72 - 3095.16: misinformation what's misinformation 3095.16 - 3097.92: right I agree and some of these are 3097.92 - 3100.14: age-old problems our legal system common 3100.14 - 3101.70: law has been struggling with what is 3101.70 - 3104.16: incitement to violence since the first 3104.16 - 3105.96: Supreme Court decisions in the 18th 3105.96 - 3108.60: century right so so you're absolutely 3108.60 - 3110.94: right but I will say this there are 3110.94 - 3112.02: certain things that are clearly 3112.02 - 3113.82: incitement to violence I'll give you 3113.82 - 3116.76: very clear examples uh I'll just make it 3116.76 - 3118.38: personal right my wife is an elected 3118.38 - 3120.12: official here in Austin there have been 3120.12 - 3121.40: people who put things up on Twitter 3121.40 - 3124.08: calling for her to be hanged or calling 3124.08 - 3126.24: for her to be attacked that's incitement 3126.24 - 3128.40: of violence when you specifically call 3128.40 - 3130.74: for violence against someone I agree 3130.74 - 3131.82: there's a lot of other stuff where it's 3131.82 - 3134.34: a gray area but we could start 3134.34 - 3136.74: if we're applying these rules 3136.74 - 3138.96: yes by getting that material off of 3138.96 - 3141.42: these sites so some of that is a problem 3141.42 - 3143.64: of scale too but the gray area is still 3143.64 - 3146.46: a forever problem that we may never be 3146.46 - 3148.74: able to solve and maybe the tension 3148.74 - 3151.02: within the gray area is the very process 3151.02 - 3153.24: of democracy but saying like we need to 3153.24 - 3154.98: take our country back 3154.98 - 3156.78: is that excitement of violence I don't 3156.78 - 3157.92: think that I think we need to take our 3157.92 - 3159.54: country back just that no 3159.54 - 3161.10: but then you know because I might say 3161.10 - 3162.78: that I might say we need to take I say 3162.78 - 3164.52: that all the time I go again I walk 3164.52 - 3166.20: around drunk just screaming at everybody 3166.20 - 3168.36: I know you wanted it wants to take you 3168.36 - 3171.42: back exactly I was very confused and my 3171.42 - 3173.16: messaging needs to work but let's let's 3173.16 - 3175.08: go to the January 6th example right to 3175.08 - 3176.88: say hang Mike Pence that's insight into 3176.88 - 3181.98: violence yeah to say go get Nancy 3181.98 - 3184.56: that's incitement to violence yeah yeah 3184.56 - 3186.12: it's very clear I again I don't think 3186.12 - 3187.38: that's the big problem the big problem 3187.38 - 3189.60: is the gray area but yet 3189.60 - 3192.30: uh and the other problems just how to 3192.30 - 3194.94: get how to technically find the large 3194.94 - 3197.76: scale of comments and posts and so on 3197.76 - 3201.72: that are doing this kind of clearance I 3201.72 - 3204.18: mean don't ask me those questions well I 3204.18 - 3206.46: have to say some of that is motivation 3206.46 - 3208.14: some of that is vision and some of that 3208.14 - 3210.60: is execution so for example just to go 3210.60 - 3213.48: out briefly on a dark topic 3213.48 - 3215.10: um something I've recently became aware 3215.10 - 3216.60: of is you know 3216.60 - 3219.06: Facebook and Twitter and so on people 3219.06 - 3221.34: post uh violence on there like little 3221.34 - 3224.70: like videos of violence child porn 3224.70 - 3226.86: um some of the darkest things in this 3226.86 - 3230.40: world and to find them at scale is is a 3230.40 - 3231.60: difficult problem 3231.60 - 3234.24: and to act in it aggressively is a 3234.24 - 3238.02: difficult problem but uh that 3238.02 - 3239.34: I think 3239.34 - 3241.38: part of this motivation like saying this 3241.38 - 3243.06: is a big problem we need to take this on 3243.06 - 3246.06: we need to uh find all the darkest 3246.06 - 3248.22: aspects of human nature that rise and 3248.22 - 3250.14: appear on our platform and remove them 3250.14 - 3253.08: so that we can create a place for like 3253.08 - 3255.18: for Humanity to flourish through the 3255.18 - 3256.62: process of conversation but it's just 3256.62 - 3258.24: hard it's just really hard when you look 3258.24 - 3260.52: at like millions of posts trillions of 3260.52 - 3263.64: interactions it's wild what's like the 3263.64 - 3266.16: amount of data but where we are now with 3266.16 - 3268.56: with social media seemed wild and 3268.56 - 3270.90: impossible five years ago right yes I I 3270.90 - 3274.20: actually what frustrates me is I think 3274.20 - 3275.88: they're people who have politicized this 3275.88 - 3278.60: issue in unnecessary ways everyone 3278.60 - 3280.50: regardless of their politics should 3280.50 - 3282.96: support what you just said investing our 3282.96 - 3283.80: money 3283.80 - 3285.84: maybe grants from uh the federal 3285.84 - 3289.20: government in AI skilled people like you 3289.20 - 3291.30: figuring out ways to get violent videos 3291.30 - 3293.64: yeah off of there that that shouldn't be 3293.64 - 3294.72: political 3294.72 - 3296.58: well some of that also requires being 3296.58 - 3298.20: transparent from a social media company 3298.20 - 3300.84: perspective and transparent in a way 3300.84 - 3303.02: that really resists uh being political 3303.02 - 3306.00: to be able to be transparent about your 3306.00 - 3307.98: fight against these 3307.98 - 3311.40: uh evils while still not succumbing to 3311.40 - 3313.98: the sort of the political narratives of 3313.98 - 3316.32: it oh that's tricky but you have to do 3316.32 - 3318.48: that kind of and I think walk calmly 3318.48 - 3319.92: through the fire because that's that's 3319.92 - 3321.42: what Twitter feels like if you're being 3321.42 - 3323.76: political is it it's like a firing squad 3323.76 - 3325.56: from every side you know as a leader you 3325.56 - 3326.94: have to kind of walk calmly right and 3326.94 - 3329.22: and that is where we need a new 3329.22 - 3331.98: generation of people who will have 3331.98 - 3334.32: diverse politics but will stand up 3334.32 - 3335.88: against that right I mean that's the 3335.88 - 3337.92: lesson from after the Civil War is where 3337.92 - 3340.56: progress is made the war doesn't solve 3340.56 - 3342.78: problems of hate where progress is made 3342.78 - 3344.22: is where you have local leaders and 3344.22 - 3345.72: others who stand up and say we can 3345.72 - 3347.76: differ but we're not going we're going 3347.76 - 3349.38: to stop calling people from certain 3349.38 - 3351.18: backgrounds monkeys which was a common 3351.18 - 3353.52: thing to do at that time Jews are still 3353.52 - 3355.02: called monkeys in certain places right 3355.02 - 3357.60: uh people have to stand up while still 3357.60 - 3360.24: maintaining their political differences 3360.24 - 3363.12: several hundred thousand people died oh 3363.12 - 3366.42: what made this war such a deadly War 3366.42 - 3368.22: it's extraordinary how many people died 3368.22 - 3370.62: more than more than half a million and 3370.62 - 3372.90: this was without a single automatic 3372.90 - 3375.12: rifle without a single bomb it was 3375.12 - 3377.16: mostly in hand-to-hand combat which is 3377.16 - 3380.70: to say that these 600 000 or so people 3380.70 - 3382.38: who died they died were the person who 3382.38 - 3384.18: killed them was standing within a few 3384.18 - 3385.38: feet of them 3385.38 - 3387.60: uh that's really hard most of the 3387.60 - 3389.22: killing that happens in Wars today is 3389.22 - 3391.32: actually from a distance it's by a drone 3391.32 - 3393.96: it's by a bomb it's by a rocket or by an 3393.96 - 3396.54: you know an automatic weapon and just to 3396.54 - 3399.54: make this even more focused uh to this 3399.54 - 3401.82: day the deadliest day in American 3401.82 - 3403.68: history was during the Civil War 3403.68 - 3407.70: September 1862 in Antietam more than 22 3407.70 - 3410.52: 000 Americans uh kill one another 3410.52 - 3413.04: uh hand to hand uh there hasn't been a 3413.04 - 3414.48: day that deadly in American history 3414.48 - 3416.16: since then that's amazing considering 3416.16 - 3418.98: the technological changes what was in 3418.98 - 3420.60: the mind of those soldiers on each side 3420.60 - 3422.70: was there conviction for ideas was it 3422.70 - 3425.10: did they hate the other side I think 3425.10 - 3428.04: actually they were fighting out of fear 3428.04 - 3430.20: what we what we know from Reading their 3430.20 - 3432.42: letters what we know from the accounts 3432.42 - 3435.60: is that yes their their ideas that are 3435.60 - 3437.34: promoted to them to get them to the 3437.34 - 3438.96: battlefield they believe in what they're 3438.96 - 3440.94: doing but here it's the same as World 3440.94 - 3442.44: War one and I think the civil war in 3442.44 - 3444.78: World War One are very similar as Wars 3444.78 - 3447.06: you are in these horrible conditions 3447.06 - 3449.04: you're attacked and you have the chance 3449.04 - 3451.92: to either kill the other side and live 3451.92 - 3453.36: or die 3453.36 - 3456.24: and you fight to live and you fight to 3456.24 - 3459.24: save the people next to you uh what is 3459.24 - 3461.16: true about war what is both good and 3461.16 - 3463.74: dangerous about it is you form an almost 3463.74 - 3465.48: unparalleled Bond 3465.48 - 3467.88: with those on your side this is uh the 3467.88 - 3470.70: men underarms scenario right and and 3470.70 - 3472.20: that's where the killing goes and it's a 3472.20 - 3474.60: Civil War which means sometimes it's 3474.60 - 3477.24: brother against brother uh uh quite 3477.24 - 3479.28: literally and what it teaches us 3479.28 - 3481.98: is how human beings can be put into 3481.98 - 3484.80: fighting and will commit enormous damage 3484.80 - 3486.48: and that's why this happens it goes on 3486.48 - 3489.48: for four years and just the extensive 3489.48 - 3492.78: research you've done on this war for 3492.78 - 3495.48: this book uh what are some some of the 3495.48 - 3497.16: worst and some of the best aspects of 3497.16 - 3499.98: human nature that you you found like you 3499.98 - 3502.02: said brother against brother 3502.02 - 3503.94: that's pretty powerful 3503.94 - 3506.10: they're both right so the level of 3506.10 - 3507.48: violence that human beings are capable 3507.48 - 3509.70: of how long they're able to sustain it 3509.70 - 3511.32: the South should not have the 3511.32 - 3512.88: Confederacy should not have lasted in 3512.88 - 3515.64: this war as long as it did by the end I 3515.64 - 3518.52: mean they're they're starving and they 3518.52 - 3519.84: keep fighting 3519.84 - 3523.08: so the resilience in War of societies 3523.08 - 3524.76: and 3524.76 - 3527.76: um the power of hate to move people 3527.76 - 3531.24: what are the bright sides uh you see in 3531.24 - 3533.64: Lincoln and Grant who I talk about a lot 3533.64 - 3535.50: in the book as well Ulysses Grant you 3535.50 - 3537.84: see the ability of empathetic figures to 3537.84 - 3539.76: still Rise Above This in spite of all 3539.76 - 3542.82: the horror Lincoln went to visit more 3542.82 - 3545.22: soldiers in war than any president ever 3545.22 - 3546.24: has 3546.24 - 3548.10: often at personal Peril because he was 3548.10 - 3550.68: close to the lines and he connected it 3550.68 - 3552.72: wasn't propaganda there weren't always 3552.72 - 3555.36: reporters following him he was able to 3555.36 - 3558.06: build empathy in this context 3558.06 - 3561.36: and I think as I said war is horrible as 3561.36 - 3563.34: it is often gives opportunities to 3563.34 - 3565.38: certain groups so African-Americans 3565.38 - 3567.42: former slaves are able to prove 3567.42 - 3570.30: themselves as Citizens Jews did this an 3570.30 - 3571.98: enormous number in World War II Henry 3571.98 - 3574.26: Kissinger I wrote about before he really 3574.26 - 3576.18: only gets recognized as an American he's 3576.18 - 3578.16: a German Jewish immigrant he's seen as 3578.16 - 3579.90: an American because of his service in 3579.90 - 3582.24: World War II so the bright side of this 3582.24 - 3585.42: is that often in the case of War on your 3585.42 - 3587.88: own side you will let go of some of your 3587.88 - 3589.44: prejudices 3589.44 - 3590.94: Ulysses Grant has a total transformation 3590.94 - 3593.04: he goes into the Civil War and 3593.04 - 3596.22: anti-semite and a racist he comes out 3596.22 - 3597.90: with actually very enlightened views 3597.90 - 3600.48: because he sees what Jewish soldiers and 3600.48 - 3602.04: what African-American soldiers did 3602.04 - 3605.22: what's Ulysses Grant's story what uh 3605.22 - 3607.20: what do you learn from him was he a hero 3607.20 - 3609.60: or a villain of this War I think he's a 3609.60 - 3611.88: hero uh though he's a flawed hero as all 3611.88 - 3613.38: heroes are 3613.38 - 3618.48: um he's a man from Ohio and Illinois who 3618.48 - 3620.52: uh was a really a failed businessman 3620.52 - 3622.56: time and again 3622.56 - 3626.76: um and uh had an ability to command 3626.76 - 3628.92: people in War uh where did this come 3628.92 - 3631.44: from he was a clear communicator and an 3631.44 - 3633.42: empathetic figure he tended to drink too 3633.42 - 3635.46: much but he was the kind of person 3635.46 - 3638.70: people wanted to follow they trusted him 3638.70 - 3641.10: and so in battle that became very 3641.10 - 3643.26: important and the second thing is he did 3643.26 - 3645.54: his homework and he had a sense of the 3645.54 - 3646.92: terrain he had a sense of the 3646.92 - 3648.84: environment he was operating in and he 3648.84 - 3651.24: was ruthless in pursuing what he had 3651.24 - 3654.18: studied so he turns out it battles as 3654.18 - 3656.28: like Vicksburg and elsewhere to actually 3656.28 - 3658.08: undertake some pretty revolutionary 3658.08 - 3662.10: maneuvers and then he figures out that 3662.10 - 3664.50: the advantage now is on his side in 3664.50 - 3668.04: numbers and he just poundsly pounds him 3668.04 - 3669.24: to death similar what the United States 3669.24 - 3671.22: does at the end of World War II with 3671.22 - 3673.20: Germany and Japan he comes out of the 3673.20 - 3675.36: war Grant does he's a believer in Union 3675.36 - 3677.70: he wants to protect 3677.70 - 3680.76: um former slaves and other groups and he 3680.76 - 3682.20: tries to use the military for that 3682.20 - 3684.06: purpose he's limited and then as 3684.06 - 3686.58: president he tries to do that as well uh 3686.58 - 3689.94: right now we still use many of the laws 3689.94 - 3691.14: that were passed during Grant's 3691.14 - 3693.12: presidency to prosecute insurrectionists 3693.12 - 3695.64: so the 900 or so people who have been 3695.64 - 3697.98: prosecuted for breaking into the capital 3697.98 - 3700.20: and attacking police on January 6. those 3700.20 - 3702.42: insurrectionists they've been prosecuted 3702.42 - 3706.14: under the 1871 anti-clu Klux Klan law so 3706.14 - 3707.94: that's a big accomplishment by Grant and 3707.94 - 3710.16: we still benefit from it the problem is 3710.16 - 3712.02: Grant was not a great politician unlike 3712.02 - 3713.28: Lincoln 3713.28 - 3716.22: he didn't give good speeches he wasn't a 3716.22 - 3718.68: persuasive figure in a political space 3718.68 - 3721.38: and so he had trouble building support 3721.38 - 3723.84: for what he was doing uh even though he 3723.84 - 3725.88: was trying to do what in the end I think 3725.88 - 3727.98: were the right things what was the role 3727.98 - 3729.60: of the KKK at that time so the Ku Klux 3729.60 - 3731.58: Klan is formed at the end of the Civil 3731.58 - 3733.98: War by Confederate Veterans first in 3733.98 - 3735.72: Tennessee in Pulaski Tennessee and then 3735.72 - 3736.92: it spreads elsewhere and there are other 3736.92 - 3739.14: groups that are similar the red shirts 3739.14 - 3742.74: and various others these are veterans of 3742.74 - 3745.80: the Confederate Army who come home 3745.80 - 3747.66: and are committed to continuing the war 3747.66 - 3750.12: they are going to use their power at 3750.12 - 3753.24: home and their weapons to intimidate and 3753.24 - 3754.98: if necessary kill people who challenge 3754.98 - 3756.90: their Authority not just African 3756.90 - 3760.32: Americans Jews Catholics various others 3760.32 - 3763.02: they are going to basically protect the 3763.02 - 3765.36: continued rule of the same families who 3765.36 - 3768.36: own the slaves before in post-slavery 3768.36 - 3771.06: Tennessee and post-slavery South 3771.06 - 3772.86: Carolina and when we get to voting 3772.86 - 3774.84: they're often the groups that are 3774.84 - 3777.36: preventing people from voting the white 3777.36 - 3780.06: sheets and the ritual around that was 3780.06 - 3782.94: all an effort to provide a certain 3782.94 - 3785.88: ritualistic legitimacy and hide identity 3785.88 - 3788.10: though everyone knew who they were oh so 3788.10 - 3789.48: that that whole brand that whole 3789.48 - 3791.82: practice was there from from have you 3791.82 - 3793.44: studied the KKK it's history a little 3793.44 - 3794.58: bit I have and there are a number of 3794.58 - 3795.90: other historians who have too so I've 3795.90 - 3798.12: used their research as well I'm kind of 3798.12 - 3800.34: curious I have to admit that my 3800.34 - 3801.42: knowledge of it is very kind of 3801.42 - 3802.62: caricature knowledge I'm sure there's 3802.62 - 3804.42: interesting stories and threads because 3804.42 - 3806.34: I think there's there different 3806.34 - 3808.08: competing organizations or something 3808.08 - 3809.46: like that of course within the United 3809.46 - 3811.68: States and I feel like they through that 3811.68 - 3813.18: lens you can tell a story of the United 3813.18 - 3815.52: States also of these different they're 3815.52 - 3816.96: often business associations I mean 3816.96 - 3819.00: there's a lot of work showing that 3819.00 - 3821.40: they're actually people join the KKK for 3821.40 - 3822.96: the reasons I just laid out but also 3822.96 - 3824.46: because it was networking for your 3824.46 - 3826.80: business you gained legitimacy in the 3826.80 - 3828.54: area that you that you were in so this 3828.54 - 3829.86: these were 3829.86 - 3832.14: Community groups that were formed to 3832.14 - 3834.60: help white business people they helped 3834.60 - 3837.12: white sheriffs get elected what we have 3837.12 - 3839.04: to understand today is when we're 3839.04 - 3841.50: debating policing this history matters 3841.50 - 3843.84: enormously right I I have nothing 3843.84 - 3846.36: against police my cousin one of my 3846.36 - 3848.04: closest relatives just retired from 25 3848.04 - 3849.48: years in the New York Police Department 3849.48 - 3851.52: thank God he survived I have deep 3851.52 - 3852.90: respects one of the best public servants 3852.90 - 3855.12: I know but what we also have to 3855.12 - 3856.98: recognize as we respect police officers 3856.98 - 3859.26: is that for many communities 3859.26 - 3861.48: in our country they know this history 3861.48 - 3864.60: and the KKK in the 1870s and in the 3864.60 - 3867.36: 1930s you look at any KKK organization 3867.36 - 3868.86: as I have in my research and you find 3868.86 - 3872.94: the police Chiefs or the KKK members the 3872.94 - 3874.74: local police officers local judges 3874.74 - 3876.84: because it was how you became police 3876.84 - 3879.90: chief so the these groups infiltrated 3879.90 - 3882.60: some of the main institutions in our in 3882.60 - 3883.74: our nation I don't even think they 3883.74 - 3885.12: infiltrated I think they were part of 3885.12 - 3887.04: those institutions the deeper question 3887.04 - 3890.76: today in the 21st century is uh one how 3890.76 - 3892.62: much of that is still there and how much 3892.62 - 3894.84: of the history of that reverberates 3894.84 - 3896.46: through the institutions and I'm making 3896.46 - 3898.14: the latter point that it's not there 3898.14 - 3900.60: that much now but people remember it 3900.60 - 3903.00: well and some people would even say it's 3903.00 - 3905.04: not there at all that there is not 3905.04 - 3907.68: institutional racism or policing 3907.68 - 3910.80: uh but if if that's the case then you 3910.80 - 3913.50: can also say that if there is not direct 3913.50 - 3915.72: institutional racism there what is it 3915.72 - 3918.12: the Echoes of History still have effects 3918.12 - 3920.04: of course and that and that's and that's 3920.04 - 3921.12: really important in that we have to take 3921.12 - 3923.16: that seriously that's not an excuse for 3923.16 - 3925.44: people then saying nasty things about 3925.44 - 3927.96: the police but it is what we have to 3927.96 - 3930.84: recognize look I'm Jewish and there are 3930.84 - 3931.92: certain 3931.92 - 3934.92: um elements of Russian Behavior today I 3934.92 - 3936.84: see in Ukraine that reverberate with the 3936.84 - 3939.78: history of how my grandparents dealt 3939.78 - 3942.54: with pogroms in Russia right even though 3942.54 - 3944.46: what Putin is doing in Ukraine might not 3944.46 - 3946.92: technically be a pogrom that history 3946.92 - 3949.26: matters and how I view these issues and 3949.26 - 3951.60: and that's a reality yeah I had I went 3951.60 - 3953.82: to 7-Eleven recently 3953.82 - 3957.00: and uh uh what did I eat ate one of 3957.00 - 3958.62: their salads 3958.62 - 3961.20: I'm sorry I love 7-Eleven I'm sorry it's 3961.20 - 3963.48: one of the cells and got like terrible 3963.48 - 3965.58: food poisoning oh I was suffering for 3965.58 - 3967.86: like four days and now I can't I love 3967.86 - 3969.78: seven I love going to 7-Eleven late at 3969.78 - 3972.18: night in sweatpants and just I escaped 3972.18 - 3974.16: the world I'm listening to an audiobook 3974.16 - 3977.40: and now every time I pass that salad for 3977.40 - 3979.62: the rest of my life I would have hate 3979.62 - 3982.80: for that salad so history matters even 3982.80 - 3986.04: if the salad is no longer have any bad 3986.04 - 3987.96: stuff in it it's probably the lettuce or 3987.96 - 3989.58: something whatever 3989.58 - 3992.16: um mostly for humor's sake but I'm also 3992.16 - 3995.76: giving a a kind of metaphor that 3995.76 - 3999.66: um history can have an individual and a 3999.66 - 4002.30: large-scale society effect on on human 4002.30 - 4005.60: interactions both the good and the bad 4005.60 - 4007.40: if you actually recommend to me offline 4007.40 - 4009.50: uh books on the KKK they'll be really 4009.50 - 4011.54: happy there were a few mentioned in in 4011.54 - 4013.82: the in the footnotes in my book here and 4013.82 - 4015.56: also in part because I also want to 4015.56 - 4017.72: understand the white nationalism white 4017.72 - 4020.42: supremacists uh Christian supremacists 4020.42 - 4022.04: of Christian nationalism all those 4022.04 - 4024.56: different subgroups in the United States 4024.56 - 4027.14: and also around the world I'm a bit 4027.14 - 4029.00: my mind has been focused on some of the 4029.00 - 4030.62: better aspects of human nature that it's 4030.62 - 4033.44: nice to also understand uh some of the 4033.44 - 4035.12: darker aspects 4035.12 - 4036.50: um let me ask you sort of a personal 4036.50 - 4039.02: question for me do you think it's 4039.02 - 4040.34: possible 4040.34 - 4043.58: do you think it's useful to do a podcast 4043.58 - 4045.08: conversation with somebody like David 4045.08 - 4046.16: Duke 4046.16 - 4049.52: or somebody 4049.52 - 4052.10: this was somebody that everybody knows 4052.10 - 4053.42: so it's not like you're giving a 4053.42 - 4056.90: platform to to somebody that's a hidden 4056.90 - 4057.62: um 4057.62 - 4060.56: member of the KKK or like uh it's sort 4060.56 - 4062.84: of putting a a pretty face on some dark 4062.84 - 4065.06: ideas but everybody knows and so now 4065.06 - 4066.74: you're just exploring you're sitting 4066.74 - 4069.62: across the table maybe not in his case 4069.62 - 4071.90: um maybe somebody who's an active KKK 4071.90 - 4074.84: member sitting across from a person that 4074.84 - 4076.64: literally hates me 4076.64 - 4080.06: Flex I think that's fascinating too I do 4080.06 - 4083.78: too I I think uh so long as what you are 4083.78 - 4084.98: doing 4084.98 - 4087.92: is not boosting someone so taking an 4087.92 - 4089.24: obscure figure 4089.24 - 4092.60: and making that figure now famous yes uh 4092.60 - 4094.04: but if it's someone who's already 4094.04 - 4097.28: Infamous yeah and it helps us to 4097.28 - 4099.14: understand them and as so long as your 4099.14 - 4100.22: effort 4100.22 - 4102.32: is to ask them tough questions which you 4102.32 - 4104.72: do right you don't you don't give them 4104.72 - 4106.70: all the questions in advance you don't 4106.70 - 4109.04: have limitations on what you can ask so 4109.04 - 4111.32: long as it is a real interview not 4111.32 - 4114.32: pablum then I'm for it what I'm what I'm 4114.32 - 4116.84: against is a softball interview that 4116.84 - 4118.46: allows someone to sound reasonable when 4118.46 - 4119.84: they're not uh but the way I've seen you 4119.84 - 4121.28: do this when you've had figures like 4121.28 - 4122.60: that I won't name who I have in mind but 4122.60 - 4125.00: when I've seen that is I I think that's 4125.00 - 4126.50: I think that's useful because honestly 4126.50 - 4128.78: uh the historian and me and the citizen 4128.78 - 4131.12: in me wants to understand 4131.12 - 4134.12: um my my Jewish grandfather always was 4134.12 - 4136.34: the the first to be against any effort 4136.34 - 4139.16: to suppress anti-semites because his 4139.16 - 4141.56: view was he wanted to know who they were 4141.56 - 4143.00: and he wanted to know what they thought 4143.00 - 4144.56: so he could be prepared 4144.56 - 4147.26: and I also see like perhaps as a 4147.26 - 4149.90: historian 4149.90 - 4151.64: you may be able to appreciate this kind 4151.64 - 4153.08: of thing that's probably how you see the 4153.08 - 4154.22: world but 4154.22 - 4156.38: there's several ways to see a human 4156.38 - 4158.60: being like Vladimir Putin is an example 4158.60 - 4162.08: one is a political figure that's 4162.08 - 4163.52: currently 4163.52 - 4166.46: doing actions on the world geopolitics 4166.46 - 4168.98: internally the politics of Russia but 4168.98 - 4171.32: there's also that human being in a 4171.32 - 4172.82: historical context 4172.82 - 4174.80: and collecting information about that 4174.80 - 4176.54: person in the historical context is also 4176.54 - 4178.46: very valuable so you could see 4178.46 - 4180.08: interviews with Hitler 4180.08 - 4184.76: in uh 39 40 41 as being very bad and 4184.76 - 4186.98: detrimental 4186.98 - 4188.96: to all that is good in the world but at 4188.96 - 4190.64: the same time it's important to 4190.64 - 4193.94: understand that human mind how it uh how 4193.94 - 4195.56: power affects that mind how power 4195.56 - 4197.00: corrupts it how they see the world 4197.00 - 4199.70: absolutely absolutely I would be all in 4199.70 - 4201.68: favor and maybe he will if Vladimir 4201.68 - 4203.96: Putin would sit down with you absolutely 4203.96 - 4206.06: I I don't think you're boosting someone 4206.06 - 4207.26: like that when you ask them tough 4207.26 - 4208.64: questions in fact I think that's what we 4208.64 - 4210.74: need to do those sorts of figures tend 4210.74 - 4212.30: to insulate themselves from tough 4212.30 - 4215.42: questions so just to restate I I am for 4215.42 - 4219.14: the Lex Friedman interview of uh those 4219.14 - 4221.42: sorts of figures I am not for the puff 4221.42 - 4224.66: piece on Fox and Friends uh where they 4224.66 - 4227.24: just come on and they're asked oh isn't 4227.24 - 4229.52: it tell us what you think of this tell 4229.52 - 4231.38: us what you think of that yeah so but 4231.38 - 4233.78: there's a balance there because 4233.78 - 4235.34: a lot of people that interview somebody 4235.34 - 4237.80: like Vladimir Putin all they do is 4237.80 - 4240.08: heart-handing questions they often 4240.08 - 4241.94: demonstrate a lack of knowledge of the 4241.94 - 4243.26: perspective of the Russian people and 4243.26 - 4245.24: the president there's not an empathy to 4245.24 - 4247.10: understand that this is a popularly 4247.10 - 4249.62: elected uh you can criticize that notion 4249.62 - 4251.54: but this is still the area that 4251.54 - 4253.76: represents the beliefs of a large number 4253.76 - 4255.56: of people and they have their own life 4255.56 - 4256.88: story they see the world they believe 4256.88 - 4258.98: they're doing good for the world and I 4258.98 - 4260.54: don't 4260.54 - 4263.42: um that idea 4263.42 - 4265.82: seems to not permeate the questions and 4265.82 - 4267.14: the thoughts that people say because 4267.14 - 4269.72: they're afraid of being attacked by the 4269.72 - 4271.88: people back home fellow journalists for 4271.88 - 4274.52: not being hard enough well maybe I think 4274.52 - 4276.68: that's probably true I think in my 4276.68 - 4279.44: experience with interviewers is that a 4279.44 - 4280.94: lot of them are really lazy you're not 4280.94 - 4283.76: which is why I like talking can I just 4283.76 - 4285.50: say okay this is not you saying it can I 4285.50 - 4286.94: just rant 4286.94 - 4289.22: if you're sitting across from Xi Jinping 4289.22 - 4293.36: from Vladimir Putin you you you should 4293.36 - 4296.00: be fired if you have not read like at 4296.00 - 4299.06: least several books on the guy the the 4299.06 - 4301.16: surprising lack of research that people 4301.16 - 4303.14: do leading up to it right so you need to 4303.14 - 4305.78: be a historian or a biographer you need 4305.78 - 4307.10: to be the kind of person that writes 4307.10 - 4309.20: biographies or histories before you sit 4309.20 - 4311.92: in front of the person not uh 4311.92 - 4314.60: not a low effort journalist and it's so 4314.60 - 4316.64: surprising to me that I think they're 4316.64 - 4317.96: probably really busy and it's probably 4317.96 - 4319.82: not part of the culture of the people 4319.82 - 4322.22: that do interviews to do deep deep like 4322.22 - 4324.14: investigative you need to be the kind of 4324.14 - 4327.14: person that lives that idea like see it 4327.14 - 4328.82: as a documentary that you work on for 4328.82 - 4331.46: three years kind of thing anyway that uh 4331.46 - 4333.20: of course some journalists do do that 4333.20 - 4334.58: and they do that masterfully and that's 4334.58 - 4336.62: the best of Journalism but I think a lot 4336.62 - 4338.24: of the times when the questions are as 4338.24 - 4340.52: you said uh out of touch with the 4340.52 - 4342.14: society that person that person is 4342.14 - 4344.00: leading it's because the interviewer 4344.00 - 4345.70: hasn't taken the time and I understand 4345.70 - 4348.02: uh you can't be an expert on every 4348.02 - 4349.76: subject but you can do what you do right 4349.76 - 4351.86: you read my book to prepare for this you 4351.86 - 4354.38: look things up you had a sense of the 4354.38 - 4356.24: person you're talking to and you put the 4356.24 - 4358.40: time in to do that this is what I always 4358.40 - 4360.62: tell my students right the secret to 4360.62 - 4362.84: success in anything is outworking other 4362.84 - 4365.60: people be more prepared right what you 4365.60 - 4367.70: show is like an iceberg it's the tip of 4367.70 - 4369.32: the iceberg right is what what people 4369.32 - 4371.48: see it's all the work that goes on below 4371.48 - 4373.10: the surface and if you work hard enough 4373.10 - 4375.50: which I aspire to do at the end of the 4375.50 - 4377.24: day just like an animal farm you'll be 4377.24 - 4379.52: like the horse boxer and slaughtered 4379.52 - 4382.04: unjustly by those that are much more 4382.04 - 4383.54: powerful than you because you'll be 4383.54 - 4385.52: happy when you're slaughtered you have 4385.52 - 4387.98: lived for the right idea and history 4387.98 - 4390.80: will remember you fondly okay uh what 4390.80 - 4392.36: about Robert E Lee so he's the 4392.36 - 4393.44: Confederate generality that you 4393.44 - 4395.66: mentioned yeah uh was he a hero or 4395.66 - 4397.22: villain to me he's a villain many people 4397.22 - 4399.26: treat Robert E Lee as a hero and one of 4399.26 - 4401.54: the points I make in the book is we have 4401.54 - 4403.10: to rethink that and it's very important 4403.10 - 4404.78: for our society because Robert E Lee 4404.78 - 4407.30: pops up all over our society names of 4407.30 - 4409.82: schools names of streets and he also 4409.82 - 4411.92: embeds and justifies certain behaviors 4411.92 - 4414.02: that I think are really bad Lee was a 4414.02 - 4416.66: was a tremendous General he had the 4416.66 - 4418.58: weaker side and he managed to use 4418.58 - 4422.24: maneuver or secrecy and Circumstance to 4422.24 - 4423.86: give himself so many advantages and win 4423.86 - 4425.78: so many battles he should have lost so 4425.78 - 4428.42: in terms of the technical generalship uh 4428.42 - 4431.30: he's a great General but Lee at the end 4431.30 - 4433.46: of the war never wants to really 4433.46 - 4435.92: acknowledge defeat what he acknowledges 4435.92 - 4438.98: at Appomattox is that his soldiers will 4438.98 - 4440.42: have to leave the battlefield because 4440.42 - 4442.82: they have not won on the battlefield but 4442.82 - 4445.64: he refuses to do what Grant asks him 4445.64 - 4448.64: which is to help sell his side on the 4448.64 - 4450.32: fact that we're going into a post-war 4450.32 - 4452.60: moment where they don't have to see 4452.60 - 4454.40: themselves as losers but they have to 4454.40 - 4456.86: get on board with change real leadership 4456.86 - 4460.10: is convincing people who follow you that 4460.10 - 4461.60: they have to change when they don't want 4461.60 - 4464.84: to change Lee refuses to do that he says 4464.84 - 4466.28: to Grant I quote this in the book he 4466.28 - 4468.50: says to granted Appomattox if you want 4468.50 - 4470.06: to change the South you have to run your 4470.06 - 4472.46: army over the South three or four times 4472.46 - 4474.38: he's not going to do anything he's not 4474.38 - 4477.56: going to help and uh he becomes a figure 4477.56 - 4480.50: who people rally around and in the rest 4480.50 - 4483.14: of his life and even after he dies so it 4483.14 - 4484.52: is as if 4484.52 - 4487.70: at the end of World War II 4487.70 - 4491.06: Hitler had been allowed to just retire 4491.06 - 4494.12: and he didn't go back into politics but 4494.12 - 4496.10: yet he was there and he continued to 4496.10 - 4498.20: have meetings with former Nazis and 4498.20 - 4500.18: people would rally around the idea of 4500.18 - 4502.04: bringing back or going back to Hitler's 4502.04 - 4503.72: ideas think of how harmful that would be 4503.72 - 4507.08: Lee played that kind of of role after 4507.08 - 4508.94: the war and I think it's one of the 4508.94 - 4511.70: problems we have now I don't think we 4511.70 - 4513.86: should continue to Revere him because it 4513.86 - 4515.36: justifies too much of what the 4515.36 - 4517.58: Confederates stood for 4517.58 - 4519.14: and that's the difference that you 4519.14 - 4520.58: highlight between World War II and the 4520.58 - 4522.68: Civil War that in the case of Hitler 4522.68 - 4524.66: there was there was a there was an end 4524.66 - 4526.34: to that war there's a very distinctive 4526.34 - 4528.92: clear end to that war and you also uh 4528.92 - 4531.38: make the case that World War II is not a 4531.38 - 4534.62: good example not a good model of a war 4534.62 - 4537.50: to help us analyze history it's given 4537.50 - 4539.24: Americans the wrong idea what war is 4539.24 - 4541.28: because World War II ends as most wars 4541.28 - 4542.60: don't end World War II ends with a 4542.60 - 4543.92: complete defeat 4543.92 - 4545.96: of the German Army and the German 4545.96 - 4548.18: society and the near complete defeat of 4548.18 - 4549.08: Japan 4549.08 - 4551.54: and where both sides in different ways 4551.54 - 4553.70: except defeat 4553.70 - 4555.56: what I'm pointing out in the book is 4555.56 - 4557.12: that most wars don't accept with one 4557.12 - 4558.92: side don't end with one side accepting 4558.92 - 4561.56: defeat and uh generally the war 4561.56 - 4563.24: continues after the battles and this is 4563.24 - 4564.38: something that's hard for Americans to 4564.38 - 4565.94: understand our system is built with the 4565.94 - 4567.44: presumption when War is Over when we 4567.44 - 4569.54: sign a piece of paper everyone can go 4569.54 - 4570.62: home 4570.62 - 4572.90: that's not what happens I mean Civil War 4572.90 - 4575.96: is a special case it's especially a 4575.96 - 4577.94: strong case of that because the people 4577.94 - 4579.50: that fought the War is still living in 4579.50 - 4581.60: that land that's exactly right and in 4581.60 - 4583.34: this case some of them are leaders also 4583.34 - 4585.38: many of them become the leaders of the 4585.38 - 4586.96: very areas that they were leading before 4586.96 - 4589.34: uh and I think that's another lesson 4589.34 - 4592.16: here too that we did undertake after 4592.16 - 4594.08: World War II though in a flawed way we 4594.08 - 4596.90: had a Nuremberg system we did prohibit 4596.90 - 4598.76: at least Nazi leaders from coming back 4598.76 - 4600.38: into power we made an exception for the 4600.38 - 4602.06: emperor in Japan but we generally 4602.06 - 4603.68: followed the same rule uh in Japan 4603.68 - 4605.78: whereas in the United States 4605.78 - 4608.06: as I point out many of the leaders of 4608.06 - 4609.38: the Confederacy first of all don't 4609.38 - 4612.08: surrender they flee to Mexico 4612.08 - 4613.94: then they come back after they lose in 4613.94 - 4616.16: Mexico a second time they come back to 4616.16 - 4617.36: the United States and they get elected 4617.36 - 4618.20: to office 4618.20 - 4620.84: uh the guy who writes the election laws 4620.84 - 4623.42: in Texas Alexander Watkins Terrell most 4623.42 - 4625.40: people don't know this even in Texas he 4625.40 - 4627.56: was a confederate general fled to Mexico 4627.56 - 4629.54: so he committed treason by joining the 4629.54 - 4632.54: Army of Maximilian emperor of Mexico who 4632.54 - 4634.40: was put in power by Louis Napoleon after 4634.40 - 4636.86: Max Millions defeated Alexander Watkins 4636.86 - 4639.14: Terrell comes back to Texas runs for the 4639.14 - 4641.36: state legislature and then writes the 4641.36 - 4643.88: election laws it's crazy can you make 4643.88 - 4645.86: the case for that that that's a feature 4645.86 - 4647.78: of the American system not a bug that 4647.78 - 4649.46: that is an implementation of justice 4649.46 - 4651.98: that you forgive that you don't 4651.98 - 4654.86: persecute everybody on the other side of 4654.86 - 4657.32: the war maybe and I think that's a good 4657.32 - 4659.48: feature in terms of lower level 4659.48 - 4661.52: individuals but I think a bad feature of 4661.52 - 4665.48: our system is we do allow 4665.48 - 4667.28: elite figures who have committed 4667.28 - 4669.08: wrongdoing we give them many ways to get 4669.08 - 4671.24: out of punishment you are more likely to 4671.24 - 4673.16: be punished in this Society if you do 4673.16 - 4675.32: something wrong and you're not an elite 4675.32 - 4677.36: figure then if you're on a leader there 4677.36 - 4678.50: should be a proportional like 4678.50 - 4679.82: forgiveness should be equally 4679.82 - 4682.04: distributed across and it's not yeah and 4682.04 - 4683.48: it's not 4683.48 - 4685.94: but we could change it we could fix that 4685.94 - 4688.94: how do we fix that but how do how do we 4688.94 - 4690.56: fix that what I think was argued at the 4690.56 - 4691.94: end this is one of the really important 4691.94 - 4693.32: things about studying history you learn 4693.32 - 4695.60: about ideas that were not pursued that 4695.60 - 4697.82: could be pursued today uh at the end of 4697.82 - 4699.62: the Civil War there was there was an 4699.62 - 4702.56: effort to ban anyone who was in a 4702.56 - 4704.42: leadership position in the Confederacy 4704.42 - 4705.98: from ever serving in federal office 4705.98 - 4709.76: again that's the third uh element of the 4709.76 - 4711.44: 14th Amendment it's in the 14th 4711.44 - 4712.94: Amendment the 14th Amendment Clause 3 4712.94 - 4715.22: says that if you took an oath of office 4715.22 - 4717.08: meaning you were elected to office 4717.08 - 4718.46: you're an elite figure 4718.46 - 4721.16: and you violated that oath you can still 4721.16 - 4722.78: live in the country you can still get 4722.78 - 4724.70: rich but you can't run for elected 4724.70 - 4727.82: office again yeah and that what we we've 4727.82 - 4728.90: never really 4728.90 - 4731.60: uh implemented that is it obvious that 4731.60 - 4733.10: everybody who's in a leadership position 4733.10 - 4735.92: on the Confederate side 4735.92 - 4738.08: is a bad person for the future of the 4738.08 - 4739.28: United States 4739.28 - 4741.74: or is that just a safe thing to assume 4741.74 - 4744.02: for the future of the nation I think 4744.02 - 4745.94: it's the latter you know maybe people do 4745.94 - 4747.32: things for all kinds of reasons and 4747.32 - 4748.82: sometimes they have regrets 4748.82 - 4750.74: that's also why we have the pardoning 4750.74 - 4751.94: capability you could pardon someone 4751.94 - 4754.34: individually if they show you that that 4754.34 - 4756.02: they've changed yeah and it would only 4756.02 - 4758.54: create fairness because right now let's 4758.54 - 4761.72: say Lex you take out a huge huge loan 4761.72 - 4764.36: and you don't pay your loan back that 4764.36 - 4765.80: will go on your credit 4765.80 - 4767.90: and you won't get a big loan again 4767.90 - 4769.70: you don't get to say 4769.70 - 4771.14: just give me another chance you're gonna 4771.14 - 4772.58: have to prove 4772.58 - 4775.64: I think about holding public office in 4775.64 - 4776.60: the same way 4776.60 - 4780.08: if you've violated your credit rating on 4780.08 - 4782.96: that you should have a much higher road 4782.96 - 4784.82: to go to prove to us that you should be 4784.82 - 4786.80: back in office 4786.80 - 4787.94: foreign 4787.94 - 4790.88: how did the War end 4790.88 - 4792.74: in quotes 4792.74 - 4795.86: uh what was the so you said and you make 4795.86 - 4797.42: this case in the book that in some sense 4797.42 - 4799.52: the elements the tensions behind the 4799.52 - 4801.50: Civil continue to this day but 4801.50 - 4803.60: officially how did the war end so 4803.60 - 4806.90: officially the war ends at Appomattox uh 4806.90 - 4811.10: in uh the early spring of 1865 when uh 4811.10 - 4813.20: Grant has pretty much smashed Robert E 4813.20 - 4815.90: Lee's army Appomattox Courthouse is a 4815.90 - 4818.90: small town in Virginia and the two men 4818.90 - 4821.54: meet and uh their as their portraits of 4821.54 - 4823.64: this as a painting of it we have in the 4823.64 - 4826.22: book and Grant and Lee signed a paper 4826.22 - 4829.46: which basically allows lead soldiers to 4829.46 - 4831.68: leave the battlefield and leave with 4831.68 - 4833.66: their sidearms to go back home that's 4833.66 - 4834.62: pretty much 4834.62 - 4837.02: the end uh Jefferson Davis who's the 4837.02 - 4838.82: president of the Confederacy goes into 4838.82 - 4842.12: hiding he's later captured uh and then 4842.12 - 4845.12: not convicted uh but there's no formal 4845.12 - 4846.68: settlement in the way there is at the 4846.68 - 4849.14: end of World War II where uh they meet 4849.14 - 4850.88: in Yokohama Bay the US and Japanese 4850.88 - 4853.64: leaders in China this is not that 4853.64 - 4855.74: so what stands out to you as brilliant 4855.74 - 4859.04: ideas during this time and actions to of 4859.04 - 4861.68: Lincoln Abraham Lincoln so I mentioned 4861.68 - 4864.08: that his values I think a number of the 4864.08 - 4865.82: things that he does that are quite 4865.82 - 4867.32: extraordinary first 4867.32 - 4869.78: um in emancipating the slaves now the 4869.78 - 4871.94: slaves were freeing themselves but 4871.94 - 4874.52: Lincoln recognizes that he needs more 4874.52 - 4876.50: labor in the Union Army and he 4876.50 - 4878.72: recognizes that there's still a lot of 4878.72 - 4879.86: resistance 4879.86 - 4882.80: uh and what he does is he makes the case 4882.80 - 4885.92: for freeing the slaves based on the 4885.92 - 4888.08: argument not just of the moral value of 4888.08 - 4890.06: that but based on how that will benefit 4890.06 - 4892.54: the north he's able to convince 4892.54 - 4895.46: non-abolitionists to pursue abolitionist 4895.46 - 4898.82: policies uh that by serving their own 4898.82 - 4900.38: interests but he's basically saying by 4900.38 - 4903.38: 1863 or 64 is I can ask for more white 4903.38 - 4906.20: soldiers or I can bring in former slaves 4906.20 - 4907.46: would you like me to take your son or 4907.46 - 4909.08: would you like me to put in it's the 4909.08 - 4910.28: same thing Franklin Roosevelt does 4910.28 - 4912.08: during World War II he says we need to 4912.08 - 4914.60: build more planes and more tanks and I'm 4914.60 - 4916.10: sending all the soldiers off to Europe 4916.10 - 4917.84: I've got this African-American 4917.84 - 4918.98: population in the South wouldn't you 4918.98 - 4920.54: like me to move them up to Chicago so we 4920.54 - 4922.16: can win this war and build things in the 4922.16 - 4925.82: in the factories so so Lincoln uses the 4925.82 - 4926.60: war 4926.60 - 4929.48: to move the country forward morally even 4929.48 - 4931.10: if at times he's convincing people by 4931.10 - 4933.32: using other other reasons and I think 4933.32 - 4935.12: that's great politics I guess that's one 4935.12 - 4937.40: of the components of great leadership is 4937.40 - 4942.62: uh is is do the right thing for the 4942.62 - 4945.08: uh wrong reasons 4945.08 - 4947.36: or publicly sounding wrong reasons yeah 4947.36 - 4949.76: find ways to move people what we talked 4949.76 - 4951.74: about before different stories move 4951.74 - 4953.72: different people so you can tell 4953.72 - 4955.70: different stories he tells one set of 4955.70 - 4957.32: stories to the religious leaders who are 4957.32 - 4959.24: abolitionists and a different set of 4959.24 - 4961.34: stories to the New York bankers 4961.34 - 4963.14: and that's leadership you tell different 4963.14 - 4965.36: kinds of stories to move people to a new 4965.36 - 4967.22: to a new position the other thing 4967.22 - 4971.12: Lincoln is is is really brilliant at is 4971.12 - 4973.40: uh managing the international side of 4973.40 - 4976.04: this so one of the real dangers for the 4976.04 - 4978.14: union is that the British will come in 4978.14 - 4979.40: on the side of the Confederacy the 4979.40 - 4980.60: Confederates expected the British 4980.60 - 4982.10: because again the Confederates were 4982.10 - 4984.38: selling all their cotton to Britain and 4984.38 - 4985.88: they knew that the British leadership 4985.88 - 4987.98: first of all was very happy to work with 4987.98 - 4989.36: slave holding societies even though they 4989.36 - 4991.58: didn't have slaves and number two that 4991.58 - 4993.32: they believe the union was getting too 4993.32 - 4994.70: strong and threatening the British in 4994.70 - 4996.68: Canada so there were many reasons the 4996.68 - 4998.48: British might have gone in with the 4998.48 - 5001.06: Confederates Lincoln mixes 5001.06 - 5003.40: um sticks and carrots with the British 5003.40 - 5006.28: he threatens them and if and when the 5006.28 - 5008.44: British actually tried to send diplomats 5008.44 - 5010.24: to negotiate with Southerners he 5010.24 - 5012.70: interdicts that he basically initiates a 5012.70 - 5014.62: quarantine of the south on the other 5014.62 - 5016.36: hand he reaches out to them 5016.36 - 5017.92: and tries to show that he wants better 5017.92 - 5019.54: relations and makes the argument that 5019.54 - 5021.70: they will actually benefit more from 5021.70 - 5023.38: having the industrial capability of the 5023.38 - 5025.60: Union on their side so he's a very good 5025.60 - 5027.22: diplomat 5027.22 - 5029.02: he is considered to be one of the great 5029.02 - 5031.00: presidents in the history of the United 5031.00 - 5032.02: States 5032.02 - 5035.32: are there ways that he failed is there 5035.32 - 5037.36: things he could have done better so he 5037.36 - 5039.04: failed in the ways that most great 5039.04 - 5040.42: leaders fail 5040.42 - 5041.92: which is that he had a terrible 5041.92 - 5043.96: succession plan 5043.96 - 5046.60: his uh vice president who I spend a lot 5046.60 - 5048.04: of time on in the book Andrew Johnson 5048.04 - 5050.14: who is probably our worst president ever 5050.14 - 5052.84: uh Andrew Johnson had no business being 5052.84 - 5055.36: anywhere near the presidency Andrew 5055.36 - 5058.96: Johnson was the only Southern senator 5058.96 - 5062.08: who did not secede and so even though he 5062.08 - 5065.08: was a Democrat Lincoln wanted to show 5065.08 - 5067.18: that he was creating a Unity ticket when 5067.18 - 5069.70: he ran for reelection in 1864. this 5069.70 - 5071.80: happens today right so he put someone on 5071.80 - 5073.90: as vice president who he didn't even 5073.90 - 5075.76: like but who he thought was politically 5075.76 - 5078.70: useful problem is when Lincoln was 5078.70 - 5079.78: assassinated 5079.78 - 5082.24: this guy took over Andrew Johnson was 5082.24 - 5084.58: drunk at his own inauguration the guy 5084.58 - 5087.58: was a true drunkard he was not prepared 5087.58 - 5089.94: to lead in any sense intellectually 5089.94 - 5092.74: politically and he was against most of 5092.74 - 5095.02: the principles Lincoln was for 5095.02 - 5098.74: and the irony is that when Lincoln is 5098.74 - 5101.62: assassinated in April of 1865 Andrew 5101.62 - 5103.30: Johnson takes over and he has all the 5103.30 - 5105.28: War Powers Lincoln had 5105.28 - 5107.32: uh that was not good Planning by Lincoln 5107.32 - 5109.42: and we can look back on it now and say 5109.42 - 5110.92: even though Lincoln is the first 5110.92 - 5113.50: president who was assassinated uh he 5113.50 - 5114.64: should have known that there were people 5114.64 - 5116.20: coming for him it wasn't inevitable that 5116.20 - 5117.40: he'd be assassinated but he should have 5117.40 - 5118.90: had a backup plan for who would take 5118.90 - 5121.36: over hopefully someone who was capable 5121.36 - 5123.16: of doing the job and Andrew Johnson was 5123.16 - 5125.56: not capable so for me for a person if I 5125.56 - 5127.24: were to put myself in in Lincoln shoes 5127.24 - 5129.10: or anybody any leadership position she 5129.10 - 5129.82: was 5129.82 - 5132.16: it is difficult to think about what 5132.16 - 5134.02: happens after my death after I'm gone 5134.02 - 5138.04: right to plan well at the same time 5138.04 - 5139.74: if you care about 5139.74 - 5143.20: your actions to have a long-term impact 5143.20 - 5145.18: it seems like you should have a 5145.18 - 5147.82: succession plan that continues on the 5147.82 - 5150.34: path yeah it continues to carry the 5150.34 - 5152.32: ideals that you've implemented 5152.32 - 5154.54: so I'm not I'm unsure why people don't 5154.54 - 5156.64: do that more often like I wonder how 5156.64 - 5159.52: much Vladimir Putin spends percentage of 5159.52 - 5160.60: time 5160.60 - 5164.44: per day thinking what happens after he's 5164.44 - 5167.26: gone to help flourish the nation and the 5167.26 - 5170.08: region that he deeply cares for I wonder 5170.08 - 5171.70: and the same as for other presidents 5171.70 - 5175.24: Donald Trump Joe Biden uh they might 5175.24 - 5177.04: think politically like how do I 5177.04 - 5178.90: guarantee that a democrat or a 5178.90 - 5181.60: republican but do they think like 5181.60 - 5183.64: um Visionary for the country I don't 5183.64 - 5185.14: know I wonder I think that's very rare 5185.14 - 5187.42: and I think uh what I understand from 5187.42 - 5189.58: the literature among business people who 5189.58 - 5191.56: talk about this a lot right is what ends 5191.56 - 5194.92: up happening is you become so powerful 5194.92 - 5196.48: you assume you're always going to be in 5196.48 - 5198.52: power you convince yourself of that you 5198.52 - 5200.08: convince yourself that the end is far 5200.08 - 5202.00: away and of course for Link in the end 5202.00 - 5203.32: could have been far away he was healthy 5203.32 - 5205.54: he was only in his 50s he could have 5205.54 - 5207.10: lived a lot longer 5207.10 - 5209.38: but it also it ended fast as it could 5209.38 - 5211.96: and and my understanding is that most 5211.96 - 5214.78: Americans don't prepare their Wills in 5214.78 - 5215.92: Estates and it doesn't matter whether 5215.92 - 5218.56: they're rich or poor they they assume 5218.56 - 5220.24: things are just going to go on because 5220.24 - 5223.84: it's not fun to think about this yeah 5223.84 - 5226.54: but I feel like it's freeing like you 5226.54 - 5227.88: know what I did which is interesting 5227.88 - 5230.38: before I went to Ukraine I recorded a 5230.38 - 5232.42: video I set up a whole thing where I 5232.42 - 5233.92: record a video like what happens if I 5233.92 - 5236.26: die I record a video to release I gave 5236.26 - 5240.10: my uh brother access to my passwords to 5240.10 - 5241.84: so that and I gave them instructions 5241.84 - 5243.04: you're not allowed to look at this but 5243.04 - 5245.50: please publish this after if I die and 5245.50 - 5247.78: you know that made me uh it sounds silly 5247.78 - 5250.12: and ridiculous but uh that made me feel 5250.12 - 5251.14: free 5251.14 - 5253.36: to do the best thing I want to do 5253.36 - 5255.28: it's like it's a it's a liberating so 5255.28 - 5256.96: like I guess that's for your will but 5256.96 - 5259.54: also like do the best possible damn job 5259.54 - 5262.42: you can I feel like as a leader having a 5262.42 - 5265.12: plan what happens if if not if you fail 5265.12 - 5267.70: if you die if you um 5267.70 - 5271.48: or or you lose some of the um some of 5271.48 - 5273.34: the power some of the momentum that is 5273.34 - 5275.20: driving you currently that there's going 5275.20 - 5277.96: to be a handoff where you will still and 5277.96 - 5279.34: you will still be remembered as a great 5279.34 - 5281.68: man or a woman that but you identify one 5281.68 - 5283.90: of the other problems right which is one 5283.90 - 5285.52: of the other reasons why someone like 5285.52 - 5287.44: Lincoln or certainly Henry Kissinger 5287.44 - 5289.78: doesn't create a successor because 5289.78 - 5291.16: you're afraid they're going to steal 5291.16 - 5292.24: your passwords you're afraid they're 5292.24 - 5293.80: gonna steal the power from you that's 5293.80 - 5295.30: true you had to find someone your 5295.30 - 5296.70: brother hopefully who you could trust 5296.70 - 5300.34: but let's just be clear I love my 5300.34 - 5302.74: brother but he's a troll so uh so 5302.74 - 5305.20: there's a feature on the past on 5305.20 - 5306.94: whatever password manager I may or may 5306.94 - 5308.92: not use uh and this is there's a bunch 5308.92 - 5310.84: of services like this it's interesting I 5310.84 - 5312.70: don't know if you you know about I've 5312.70 - 5316.86: learned about all this uh is you can 5316.86 - 5320.38: have them request access and it's going 5320.38 - 5321.88: to wait 30 days before it gives them 5321.88 - 5325.00: access so it's kind of has this um 5325.00 - 5329.56: built-in trust okay uh trust padding uh 5329.56 - 5331.06: but it's interesting I mean to me on 5331.06 - 5332.98: that aspect is just to have a plan in 5332.98 - 5334.30: all aspects of life this is for 5334.30 - 5336.64: leadership in your private life 5336.64 - 5338.62: like what happens 5338.62 - 5341.44: to not just your will and your wealth uh 5341.44 - 5343.66: your wealth or whatever but what happens 5343.66 - 5345.94: to other stuff like social media and all 5345.94 - 5347.68: that right in this Digital World 5347.68 - 5349.72: anything you care about if you wanted to 5349.72 - 5351.82: live on and that's the problem but if 5351.82 - 5352.66: you 5352.66 - 5354.58: unless you can devise 5354.58 - 5357.28: a technical solution like that you have 5357.28 - 5359.50: to give someone power now yeah and 5359.50 - 5361.12: that's the tricky thing I mean uh 5361.12 - 5363.64: democracy is a kind of Technology you 5363.64 - 5365.02: kind of have to figure out how to do it 5365.02 - 5366.82: correctly how to have how to have that 5366.82 - 5368.68: power propagate and especially during 5368.68 - 5371.92: war how you get everybody together into 5371.92 - 5375.04: this war-mongering mood or and then how 5375.04 - 5377.32: do you how do you like come come down 5377.32 - 5380.44: from that and just relax precisely so in 5380.44 - 5382.18: some sense that's 5382.18 - 5384.04: well there Johnson that was the the 5384.04 - 5386.50: problem is is the over centralization of 5386.50 - 5388.36: power it was the over centralization of 5388.36 - 5391.38: power but it was also that Lincoln 5391.38 - 5394.96: had a designated successor who was going 5394.96 - 5396.70: to do and tried to do everything that 5396.70 - 5398.80: ran against what Lincoln was doing and 5398.80 - 5400.72: it set the country back we went forward 5400.72 - 5402.40: at the end of the Civil War and then we 5402.40 - 5403.72: went backward 5403.72 - 5405.64: more so than we would have if there had 5405.64 - 5407.86: been a new election because if there had 5407.86 - 5409.30: been a new election there still would be 5409.30 - 5411.22: reason for that person running even if 5411.22 - 5412.54: they were on the other side to try to 5412.54 - 5414.70: find some compromise positions Andrew 5414.70 - 5416.74: Johnson inherited power 5416.74 - 5419.14: with very few limitations on how he used 5419.14 - 5420.70: that power Congress wasn't even in 5420.70 - 5421.78: session 5421.78 - 5423.70: and so this became very directly a 5423.70 - 5425.38: problem because Andrew Johnson started 5425.38 - 5427.00: pardoning Southerners allowing them to 5427.00 - 5428.32: come back into power 5428.32 - 5430.18: so we had like a few months where he 5430.18 - 5432.10: just went wild yeah 5432.10 - 5434.32: it's it's giving the car keys to someone 5434.32 - 5436.24: who's not prepared to drive but decided 5436.24 - 5437.26: that they're going to do what they want 5437.26 - 5439.30: with the car for a while 5439.30 - 5441.46: all right 5441.46 - 5443.62: is there any level to which power 5443.62 - 5447.34: corrupted Lincoln a war president yes I 5447.34 - 5448.90: do think there are some areas and I 5448.90 - 5451.06: think that even though he was a great 5451.06 - 5452.38: president if not our greatest president 5452.38 - 5454.84: maybe one of the greatest figures of the 5454.84 - 5456.52: of our history 5456.52 - 5458.68: um he was flawed uh one is his problem 5458.68 - 5461.08: of succession but also 5461.08 - 5464.98: I think Lincoln uh over invested in the 5464.98 - 5466.48: power of the presidency he came to 5466.48 - 5468.28: believe too much 5468.28 - 5470.40: in the role of one man 5470.40 - 5474.82: and not in creating a more balanced 5474.82 - 5476.14: approach to governance and that's a 5476.14 - 5477.46: function of War that's where war is 5477.46 - 5479.68: dangerous War has an inherent 5479.68 - 5482.80: centralizing power in a democracy 5482.80 - 5484.66: and that is dangerous because even when 5484.66 - 5486.34: you have the best of people running a 5486.34 - 5487.36: war 5487.36 - 5488.98: that gives them a lot of power to make 5488.98 - 5490.66: decisions yeah how do you come down from 5490.66 - 5492.64: that I see that was the landscape Putin 5492.64 - 5494.50: currently yep it's a war how do you come 5494.50 - 5496.54: down because uh 5496.54 - 5499.24: Ukraine and everybody anybody in the war 5499.24 - 5500.92: kind of especially if you're fighting 5500.92 - 5502.84: for the ideal of democracy 5502.84 - 5505.90: it seems like war is anti-democratic it 5505.90 - 5508.18: is so how do you come down from that 5508.18 - 5511.54: what's the interesting mechanism of I 5511.54 - 5512.92: mean some of it is leadership you have 5512.92 - 5514.36: to be like a George Washington type 5514.36 - 5516.70: figure be able to walk away from Power I 5516.70 - 5518.14: think you gave the answer right there 5518.14 - 5520.42: yeah you need to walk away from power or 5520.42 - 5521.80: you need to be forced to walk away from 5521.80 - 5523.54: Power historically one of the things 5523.54 - 5526.18: that democracies have tended to do when 5526.18 - 5528.22: they have a chance is to vote out of 5528.22 - 5530.32: office the Victor in the war think about 5530.32 - 5532.80: Winston Churchill 5532.80 - 5535.18: Roosevelt is elected to his fourth term 5535.18 - 5537.10: when he's still in the war it's not 5537.10 - 5539.32: clear that he would have been elected 5539.32 - 5541.18: again let's say he lived on because 5541.18 - 5543.28: there is a sensibility that the person 5543.28 - 5546.88: has become too powerful in this role and 5546.88 - 5548.50: that they someone else should now step 5548.50 - 5550.00: in someone else who's also not a war 5550.00 - 5552.60: president but has other interests so 5552.60 - 5556.30: let's hope Ukraine wins this war 5556.30 - 5559.18: um zielinski should then step down 5559.18 - 5561.40: or someone else should be voted in it 5561.40 - 5563.20: will be dangerous if he remains 5563.20 - 5565.66: president let's say he wins somehow and 5565.66 - 5567.22: a true Victory which is just 5567.22 - 5568.36: hypothetical 5568.36 - 5571.90: he should not be he should be praised 5571.90 - 5574.66: maybe given a nice Villa 5574.66 - 5576.70: um but someone else should take over 5576.70 - 5578.80: because the problem is that he's going 5578.80 - 5580.42: to have too much power 5580.42 - 5583.18: and honestly he's going to be too out of 5583.18 - 5584.62: touch with what the country needs after 5584.62 - 5585.60: the war 5585.60 - 5587.50: what do you think would have happened if 5587.50 - 5589.30: Lincoln had lived that's the sort of 5589.30 - 5591.46: counter factual view of History it's an 5591.46 - 5592.90: interesting question that probably you 5592.90 - 5594.82: think about a lot this is a lot what 5594.82 - 5596.08: would have happened if you didn't get 5596.08 - 5597.88: assassinated it's a reasonable question 5597.88 - 5599.32: because it was not inevitable he'd be 5599.32 - 5600.58: assassinated right he could have had 5600.58 - 5602.20: more protection that night he had 5602.20 - 5603.76: invited Ulysses Grant to go to the 5603.76 - 5605.44: theater with him and Grant and his wife 5605.44 - 5606.88: didn't go if they had been there there 5606.88 - 5607.84: would have been more protection for 5607.84 - 5609.46: Grant so he would have had at least 5609.46 - 5611.80: double the the security there 5611.80 - 5613.42: um so there are many ways in which he 5613.42 - 5615.16: might not have died I think it still 5615.16 - 5617.44: would have been a difficult transition 5617.44 - 5619.18: but I think there were a few things that 5619.18 - 5620.20: would have been better first of all 5620.20 - 5621.88: Lincoln would not have pardoned all of 5621.88 - 5623.20: these Confederate leaders and allowed 5623.20 - 5625.00: them to come back into Power Lincoln 5625.00 - 5626.56: also would have been a better politician 5626.56 - 5628.12: at holding his Republican Coalition 5628.12 - 5629.38: together 5629.38 - 5632.20: and I think Lincoln was more committed 5632.20 - 5634.36: to empowering former slaves and others 5634.36 - 5636.04: so we still would have had a lot of 5636.04 - 5638.20: conflicts but I think what would have 5638.20 - 5640.18: been a degree of difficulty was doubled 5640.18 - 5642.52: or tripled because 5642.52 - 5644.38: um Lincoln was was removed and the 5644.38 - 5646.06: opposite came into Power with Andrew 5646.06 - 5647.98: Johnson so you don't think there's a 5647.98 - 5650.32: case you made the Andrew Johnson was 5650.32 - 5652.84: turned out to be 5652.84 - 5654.94: a bad decision but the spirit of the 5654.94 - 5656.98: decision is the correct one no I think 5656.98 - 5659.74: it was a terrible decision because you 5659.74 - 5661.36: should never put someone one step away 5661.36 - 5663.46: from enormous power who's not prepared 5663.46 - 5666.52: oh in that sense yeah so uh in essence I 5666.52 - 5668.32: got it but but the the other the spirit 5668.32 - 5670.18: of the decision meaning you put somebody 5670.18 - 5671.98: who's in a 5671.98 - 5674.38: represents a very opposing Viewpoint 5674.38 - 5676.66: than you well I'm for that so long as 5676.66 - 5679.60: that person is on board with some of the 5679.60 - 5682.24: basic values that you're pursuing and 5682.24 - 5683.80: that person is capable of doing the job 5683.80 - 5685.36: well do you think that was obvious to 5685.36 - 5687.10: him that Andrew Johnson was not capable 5687.10 - 5689.74: of doing the job yes okay it's in the 5689.74 - 5691.54: right I mean everyone recognized that 5691.54 - 5693.70: but it made sense I mean what Lincoln 5693.70 - 5696.40: has to be praised for is in the midst of 5696.40 - 5697.36: a war 5697.36 - 5699.22: when at that point he was not doing well 5699.22 - 5701.50: the war was not going well he ran for 5701.50 - 5703.18: re-election he didn't try to postpone 5703.18 - 5704.50: the election he didn't try to do 5704.50 - 5706.54: anything yeah and and so he needed all 5706.54 - 5708.46: the help he could get when running and 5708.46 - 5709.84: so he wanted to have someone on there 5709.84 - 5711.22: who looked like a Unity candidate who 5711.22 - 5713.92: could appeal to some Southerners uh so 5713.92 - 5715.60: it made sense from a political point of 5715.60 - 5716.32: view 5716.32 - 5718.60: uh but it created a really big problem 5718.60 - 5720.34: and 5720.34 - 5722.20: um there were people who said he should 5722.20 - 5724.00: have removed Johnson as soon as he was 5724.00 - 5725.44: elected and in retrospect he probably 5725.44 - 5727.72: should have how gangster is that to 5727.72 - 5729.82: during a war still run the election 5729.82 - 5732.46: yeah it's it's extraordinary I mean he 5732.46 - 5734.62: Lincoln believed in Democratic Values he 5734.62 - 5736.18: also believed he would win but he knew 5736.18 - 5738.22: it was not guaranteed yeah and it's 5738.22 - 5739.54: interesting for for people don't know 5739.54 - 5740.62: this the reason we have mail in 5740.62 - 5742.00: balloting in the US is because of that 5742.00 - 5743.98: so 5743.98 - 5744.82: um 5744.82 - 5748.48: almost what uh I think it's almost a 5748.48 - 5749.92: million uh 5749.92 - 5752.50: Union voters are away from their homes 5752.50 - 5755.08: and so how do they vote as soldiers as 5755.08 - 5758.14: nurses they vote by mail the poster post 5758.14 - 5759.52: office delivers their ballots that's why 5759.52 - 5761.20: we have mail-in balloting 5761.20 - 5762.94: what about the other kind of factual 5762.94 - 5764.68: question of what what would have 5764.68 - 5766.18: happened if Confederate States won the 5766.18 - 5767.92: war the Confederate States had won the 5767.92 - 5769.96: war you would have seen I think a 5769.96 - 5771.52: separate country 5771.52 - 5773.26: and the South you would have seen two 5773.26 - 5775.36: countries and that Confederate country 5775.36 - 5777.46: would have been a smaller country but it 5777.46 - 5778.60: probably would have been able to defend 5778.60 - 5779.92: itself because it would have actually 5779.92 - 5781.66: gotten much richer than it was it was 5781.66 - 5783.58: poor at the time but through its cotton 5783.58 - 5784.84: trade and other things it would have 5784.84 - 5786.40: been recognized by Great Britain by 5786.40 - 5788.98: France by other societies and you would 5788.98 - 5790.36: have seen 5790.36 - 5793.12: um a southern Republic I don't think you 5793.12 - 5794.56: would have seen that southern Republic 5794.56 - 5797.56: dominate the continent the union had the 5797.56 - 5800.16: men and people and had the resources 5800.16 - 5803.14: but you would have seen a rival Republic 5803.14 - 5805.84: to the United States in the South do you 5805.84 - 5808.06: think they had interest to dominate the 5808.06 - 5809.62: continent to take over the the union 5809.62 - 5811.60: they had a foreign policy they had a 5811.60 - 5813.34: plan many have written about this they 5813.34 - 5815.20: had plans many Southerners did of 5815.20 - 5817.30: expanding into the Caribbean 5817.30 - 5819.58: which was actually more feasible they 5819.58 - 5822.04: did not have the Personnel to occupy so 5822.04 - 5823.66: much territory going out west if you 5823.66 - 5824.92: think about the amount of land that had 5824.92 - 5827.38: to be covered but they had the nautical 5827.38 - 5829.42: capabilities in Naval power and the 5829.42 - 5830.86: money 5830.86 - 5833.44: um to dominate islands in the Caribbean 5833.44 - 5834.76: and those islands were important for 5834.76 - 5836.26: their trade so there were many 5836.26 - 5837.40: Southerners who wanted to take control 5837.40 - 5840.88: of Cuba wanted to take control of Haiti 5840.88 - 5843.58: and the Dominican Republic and so you 5843.58 - 5845.32: probably would have seen Southern 5845.32 - 5848.26: Warfare in those areas 5848.26 - 5850.84: from a counter factual history 5850.84 - 5853.54: perspective can you make the case 5853.54 - 5856.84: that secession would have been created a 5856.84 - 5858.64: better world like if we're sitting today 5858.64 - 5861.16: and do Back to the Future thing that's a 5861.16 - 5863.68: session in this context if we put aside 5863.68 - 5867.34: the the suffering and the loss of life 5867.34 - 5870.16: in the war that we would be in a better 5870.16 - 5872.32: world today just look into a political 5872.32 - 5874.06: climate or and can you also make the 5874.06 - 5876.52: case that actually this outcome of the 5876.52 - 5878.86: Union winning the war is the better one 5878.86 - 5881.26: I think the union union victory is by 5881.26 - 5883.18: far the better outcome because I think 5883.18 - 5884.74: what you would have had otherwise is you 5884.74 - 5887.38: would have had a slave Republic in in 5887.38 - 5889.12: the South that would have encouraged 5889.12 - 5891.16: slavery in other parts of the world 5891.16 - 5894.40: would have exported slavery and would 5894.40 - 5898.12: have necessarily been hostile to many of 5898.12 - 5899.80: the positive changes that occur in the 5899.80 - 5901.84: union the movement toward Progressive 5901.84 - 5903.64: reforms creating cities with health 5903.64 - 5905.56: codes and public education and many of 5905.56 - 5906.82: those things public education really 5906.82 - 5908.86: develops in the north as a way of 5908.86 - 5911.14: training workers who are being paid to 5911.14 - 5913.06: be better workers in a factory there's a 5913.06 - 5914.32: reason you don't educate slaves because 5914.32 - 5916.42: if you educate slaves they'll Rebel yeah 5916.42 - 5919.30: so don't you think there'll be a huge uh 5919.30 - 5922.24: pressure from the north to about slavery 5922.24 - 5924.34: anyway it would but I think the South 5924.34 - 5926.26: could have survived without another War 5926.26 - 5928.48: I mean I think the way that slavery 5928.48 - 5931.84: would have would have ended in the South 5931.84 - 5933.76: if it didn't end with the Civil War it 5933.76 - 5935.38: would have been with another War 5935.38 - 5938.02: I guess the deeper question is is it 5938.02 - 5940.18: better to work through your problems 5940.18 - 5942.10: together or is it better to get a 5942.10 - 5943.30: divorce 5943.30 - 5945.16: I think in this case it was better to 5945.16 - 5946.78: work through the problems not even 5946.78 - 5947.62: working through them together it's 5947.62 - 5948.82: better to work through the problems 5948.82 - 5952.12: where one side has the resources to 5952.12 - 5953.68: incentivize you to work through the 5953.68 - 5955.84: problems rather than leaving you on your 5955.84 - 5957.46: own to go your own to go your own 5957.46 - 5959.74: Direction I think the argument against 5959.74 - 5962.32: the union winning would be the argument 5962.32 - 5964.18: that would be made by those who believe 5964.18 - 5966.22: they suffered from Union power later on 5966.22 - 5969.40: so you could argue if you're a historian 5969.40 - 5971.08: of Native Americans 5971.08 - 5972.88: uh if you're historian of the 5972.88 - 5974.92: Philippines You could argue some of the 5974.92 - 5977.56: areas where this newly United Nation 5977.56 - 5979.54: coming out of the Civil War was able to 5979.54 - 5981.88: use its power to spread its influence it 5981.88 - 5983.38: would have been harder for the union to 5983.38 - 5985.90: do that uh if the union had to deal with 5985.90 - 5987.70: a rival to the South 5987.70 - 5991.30: so as a historian the union won 5991.30 - 5994.84: to which degree are the people from the 5994.84 - 5996.94: union there is now the United States the 5996.94 - 5998.62: writers of the history 5998.62 - 6001.38: that that color the perspective of who's 6001.38 - 6003.66: the good guys and the bad guys so this 6003.66 - 6005.64: is such an interesting question because 6005.64 - 6007.74: I like how you take every question I ask 6007.74 - 6009.32: and make it into a better question 6009.32 - 6011.70: that's a deep I deeply appreciate it 6011.70 - 6013.68: I'll ask every time I ask some 6013.68 - 6015.30: ridiculous question and you go that's 6015.30 - 6017.28: really interesting because they're 6017.28 - 6018.48: really good questions they're thoughtful 6018.48 - 6019.74: questions you know actually the best 6019.74 - 6021.90: questions are not the simple ones right 6021.90 - 6024.48: so um 6024.48 - 6025.56: foreign 6025.56 - 6028.44: the Axiom is that the winners write 6028.44 - 6030.18: history yeah and that's usually the case 6030.18 - 6032.52: right most of the history I learned 6032.52 - 6034.44: about Ukraine when I was growing up was 6034.44 - 6036.24: written by Russians it was Russian 6036.24 - 6038.76: history of Ukraine uh most of the 6038.76 - 6040.02: history of Europe has been written by 6040.02 - 6041.82: Germans and French and and British 6041.82 - 6043.92: citizens right I mean so usually it's 6043.92 - 6045.66: that way and for the most part our 6045.66 - 6047.40: history has been written from a sort of 6047.40 - 6049.44: Northeastern point of view but it's very 6049.44 - 6051.18: interesting the history of the years 6051.18 - 6053.22: after the Civil War that I focus on in 6053.22 - 6055.26: this book has largely been written by 6055.26 - 6058.68: the losers because the union and its 6058.68 - 6060.60: legacies and I grew up in New York so 6060.60 - 6062.22: I'm growing up as a legacy of that right 6062.22 - 6064.20: those were individuals who wanted to 6064.20 - 6065.88: write about what happened long after the 6065.88 - 6068.88: Civil War when the north got rich all 6068.88 - 6070.26: those beautiful buildings in New York 6070.26 - 6072.12: all that wealth in New York it's 1880s 6072.12 - 6074.04: 90s it's The Late Late 19th centuries 6074.04 - 6075.84: the Gilded Age and that's what 6075.84 - 6077.22: Northerners want to write about right 6077.22 - 6080.16: because there's Glory there the 20 years 6080.16 - 6081.90: or so after the Civil War the years that 6081.90 - 6085.86: really count 1865 to 1880 or so uh those 6085.86 - 6088.98: years are ugly it's messy and so who 6088.98 - 6090.84: wrote about them Southerners wrote about 6090.84 - 6093.18: them and they wrote a story that was 6093.18 - 6096.54: about uh Northern Carpetbaggers and 6096.54 - 6099.60: corrupt African Americans uh and this is 6099.60 - 6102.24: the story that Americans learned until a 6102.24 - 6103.92: few years ago I've gone around the 6103.92 - 6105.42: country talking about this book and the 6105.42 - 6106.56: number of people have told me they never 6106.56 - 6108.72: learned this basic history because they 6108.72 - 6110.58: grew up in Chicago not because they grew 6110.58 - 6111.66: up in Texas because they grew up in 6111.66 - 6113.76: Chicago and the story they were told the 6113.76 - 6115.44: Civil War ended oh now let's talk about 6115.44 - 6117.60: the Chicago World's Fair in 1893 and how 6117.60 - 6119.40: Chicago is coming of age as this great 6119.40 - 6123.06: City we don't like to write history in 6123.06 - 6125.94: our country that's not about Glory I'm 6125.94 - 6127.80: all for the greatness of our country but 6127.80 - 6129.72: you become great by studying your 6129.72 - 6131.76: failures as well as your successes 6131.76 - 6134.04: and that's a real problem we have and I 6134.04 - 6136.14: would love to see a kind of humility 6136.14 - 6138.60: from uh from a history perspective one 6138.60 - 6139.74: of the things that always surprised me 6139.74 - 6142.02: just coming from the Soviet Union to to 6142.02 - 6144.48: the United States as you've I think 6144.48 - 6145.62: spoken about 6145.62 - 6148.02: is the perspective on World War II yeah 6148.02 - 6149.52: and who is the critical component of 6149.52 - 6151.68: winning the war obviously in the Soviet 6151.68 - 6155.04: Union uh it's a Great Patriotic War it's 6155.04 - 6157.50: you know uh the Soviet unions are the 6157.50 - 6159.12: ones that suffered and often actually 6159.12 - 6161.10: don't emphasize the suffering they 6161.10 - 6163.26: emphasize the glory that they defeated 6163.26 - 6165.06: this huge evil but then you listen to 6165.06 - 6166.86: the United States perspective on this 6166.86 - 6171.00: and it's almost like the the I mean 6171.00 - 6172.68: there's several ways of phrasing it but 6172.68 - 6174.18: basically the United States won the war 6174.18 - 6175.86: without the United States it would be 6175.86 - 6177.36: impossible to win the war there were the 6177.36 - 6179.64: turning point there were the the last 6179.64 - 6182.16: there were uh one of my last my 6182.16 - 6184.86: everything that that song uh um my first 6184.86 - 6187.74: my last my everything so so that and I'm 6187.74 - 6190.64: sure I wonder what what growing up 6190.64 - 6194.88: in uh maybe after war in in Britain I 6194.88 - 6196.14: wonder if there's history books written 6196.14 - 6197.52: there that basically saying they could 6197.52 - 6199.26: also make a pretty strong case that 6199.26 - 6202.32: Britain was Central to the turning point 6202.32 - 6204.48: you could really make a strong case that 6204.48 - 6207.42: like Churchill and Britain uh were like 6207.42 - 6209.10: the turning point of the war that the 6209.10 - 6210.72: that they're responsible for some of the 6210.72 - 6212.82: first failures major failures of Hitler 6212.82 - 6215.16: from a military strategy perspective but 6215.16 - 6217.62: uh that's interesting to look at that 6217.62 - 6219.54: very recent history from very different 6219.54 - 6221.04: perspectives and it's the same problem 6221.04 - 6222.42: with the Civil War we want to tell the 6222.42 - 6224.28: story of the Union winning the war and 6224.28 - 6226.62: then everything is good yeah and it's 6226.62 - 6228.96: not the way it's not the way it worked 6228.96 - 6231.96: um what I'm really trying to get at is 6231.96 - 6234.18: uh when you love your country you have 6234.18 - 6236.58: to study the failures because by 6236.58 - 6238.44: studying the failures that's how you 6238.44 - 6239.64: improve yourself and that's where you 6239.64 - 6242.04: see where where real courage is it's 6242.04 - 6244.44: actually that Lincoln failed for so long 6244.44 - 6246.78: that makes him a great president he lost 6246.78 - 6249.72: more battles than he won but he learned 6249.72 - 6251.40: and he got it right in the end same with 6251.40 - 6253.20: Ulysses Grant I don't want generals I'm 6253.20 - 6254.76: just echoing Lincoln here I don't want 6254.76 - 6256.14: generals I don't want leaders who think 6256.14 - 6257.10: they're going to get it right the first 6257.10 - 6258.18: time because they're never going to get 6258.18 - 6259.92: it right the first time you never get it 6259.92 - 6261.36: right the first time in an AI experiment 6261.36 - 6263.16: right it's those who can work through 6263.16 - 6266.46: failure learn from failure and we as a 6266.46 - 6268.20: society have to start doing that better 6268.20 - 6270.66: we have to not just trumpet the 6270.66 - 6272.46: successes let's talk about where we 6272.46 - 6275.10: failed as Republicans as Democrats as 6275.10 - 6277.26: Independents and let's move forward from 6277.26 - 6279.36: there in recent years have been a kind 6279.36 - 6280.82: of 6280.82 - 6283.74: movement of highlighting some of the 6283.74 - 6285.72: hypocrisy sort of highlighting the 6285.72 - 6287.88: racism the fact that many of the finding 6287.88 - 6289.44: fathers were slave owners that kind of 6289.44 - 6291.72: thing uh sort of highlighting from the 6291.72 - 6292.62: current 6292.62 - 6296.52: uh ethics of our world uh showing that 6296.52 - 6298.56: many of the people involved in the war 6298.56 - 6301.02: on each side were evil uh what do you 6301.02 - 6302.34: think about that perspective on history 6302.34 - 6304.56: I think it's super valuable I think we 6304.56 - 6308.58: should expose the the gap between ideals 6308.58 - 6311.16: and practice but that doesn't mean we 6311.16 - 6313.74: should throw away the great people who 6313.74 - 6315.72: are also Hypocrites because everyone 6315.72 - 6317.46: I've studied is a hypocrite I'm a 6317.46 - 6318.60: hypocrite I think I'm a pretty good 6318.60 - 6320.88: father luckily my son is an even better 6320.88 - 6324.60: mother but uh uh the parts of me there I 6324.60 - 6326.70: mean I often find myself telling our 6326.70 - 6328.38: children to do things that I didn't do 6328.38 - 6330.54: right yeah but they're smart and they 6330.54 - 6331.68: recognize that and they learn something 6331.68 - 6334.50: from that so let's not cover over 6334.50 - 6336.66: the hypocrisy but let's not throw people 6336.66 - 6338.16: away for being hypocritical here's my 6338.16 - 6339.36: view of Thomas Jefferson which is 6339.36 - 6340.74: similar to my view of Abraham Lincoln 6340.74 - 6342.96: right these are incredibly insightful 6342.96 - 6345.84: thoughtful people who added so much to 6345.84 - 6347.22: our country 6347.22 - 6351.06: but they also created flawed systems 6351.06 - 6352.56: and one of Link one of excuse me 6352.56 - 6355.08: Jefferson's flaws was even though he saw 6355.08 - 6356.46: all the evils of slavery he was a 6356.46 - 6357.66: terrible farmer and he could not imagine 6357.66 - 6359.64: living the lifestyle he lived without 6359.64 - 6362.04: slaves he could never work his way out 6362.04 - 6363.78: of that but that doesn't make the 6363.78 - 6365.22: Declaration of Independence less 6365.22 - 6366.66: valuable in fact it makes it more 6366.66 - 6368.52: valuable there's more that we can learn 6368.52 - 6370.68: from that and to me 6370.68 - 6372.96: on the hypocrisy side many of the people 6372.96 - 6374.58: that participate in cancel culture and 6374.58 - 6376.02: these kinds of movements 6376.02 - 6379.98: that call everything as racist and so on 6379.98 - 6382.80: sometimes they're highlighting uh 6382.80 - 6385.44: properly the evils in our current 6385.44 - 6386.52: Society 6386.52 - 6389.04: but the hypocrisy they have is not 6389.04 - 6392.22: realizing if they were placed in Germany 6392.22 - 6395.76: in the 40s if they were placed in the 6395.76 - 6399.08: position of being a white Christian 6399.08 - 6401.46: during slavery at the fighting of this 6401.46 - 6403.44: country they would do the same thing 6403.44 - 6405.06: they would do the evils that are not 6405.06 - 6408.36: criticizing most of them is that it 6408.36 - 6411.90: takes a truly heroic human to think 6411.90 - 6414.30: outside to be aware of all the evils 6414.30 - 6415.64: going on Assad 6415.64 - 6419.46: around you and take action it's easy now 6419.46 - 6421.74: on Twitter to call people as racist 6421.74 - 6424.44: what's hard is to see the racism when 6424.44 - 6426.42: you're living in it and your well-being 6426.42 - 6428.88: is funded by it yep I think that's right 6428.88 - 6431.40: I think to analyze ourselves and look 6431.40 - 6434.04: honestly in the mirrors very hard I also 6434.04 - 6435.66: think I make this point in actually all 6435.66 - 6437.22: of my books 6437.22 - 6439.92: um the real and it's an Eli visel point 6439.92 - 6442.62: that a lot of the evil in our world is 6442.62 - 6444.06: the evil of silence and just looking 6444.06 - 6445.20: away 6445.20 - 6447.48: and and one form of that on Twitter is 6447.48 - 6449.16: just hitting like 6449.16 - 6452.04: yeah uh it's it's a cheap way of 6452.04 - 6453.72: pretending you're you're doing something 6453.72 - 6456.06: that's important right after the Civil 6456.06 - 6458.04: War there's all sorts of bad stuff that 6458.04 - 6460.38: happens I talk about it a lot there 6460.38 - 6462.00: always are people there who could stop 6462.00 - 6463.26: it 6463.26 - 6465.24: most people are not responsible for the 6465.24 - 6467.28: bad activities but most don't do 6467.28 - 6469.38: something to stop it 6469.38 - 6471.36: and when I say do something I mean 6471.36 - 6473.10: really do something yeah really and 6473.10 - 6474.66: that's it's also to push back and 6474.66 - 6476.04: pushback 6476.04 - 6478.92: silence on Twitter is not what Eli 6478.92 - 6481.56: Rozelle was talking about 6481.56 - 6484.08: so sometimes silence on Twitter is the 6484.08 - 6486.24: courageous action because you wait and 6486.24 - 6488.76: think and learn and have patience to 6488.76 - 6490.44: truly understand the situation before 6490.44 - 6492.96: you take actual action not participate 6492.96 - 6495.66: in the outrage crowds on Twitter the 6495.66 - 6498.18: hysteria of cancellation what's hard to 6498.18 - 6500.34: do is to speak up when everybody else is 6500.34 - 6501.78: silent right that's what's hard to do 6501.78 - 6503.58: right and to speak up against those who 6503.58 - 6505.82: you thought were on your side yes 6505.82 - 6508.74: exactly good luck to those on the left 6508.74 - 6511.68: who speak up against the left uh and the 6511.68 - 6513.18: same good luck to those on the right who 6513.18 - 6515.06: speak up against the right 6515.06 - 6517.98: it's a lonely place it's a it's a 6517.98 - 6519.78: painful place that's why walking in the 6519.78 - 6521.46: center is tough you get attacked by both 6521.46 - 6523.50: sides yeah so it's a wonderful wonderful 6523.50 - 6525.90: uh journey and you know what what's 6525.90 - 6528.54: interesting to me uh and what I learned 6528.54 - 6529.86: writing this book every book is a 6529.86 - 6531.78: journey what I learned in this in the 6531.78 - 6533.76: laboratory of this book right 6533.76 - 6536.82: was a lot of those figures who do stand 6536.82 - 6537.72: up 6537.72 - 6540.42: uh even in their own lifetime they don't 6540.42 - 6542.28: get the accolades they deserve but they 6542.28 - 6544.26: make a difference and that that's maybe 6544.26 - 6546.54: not enough Comfort uh because you want 6546.54 - 6548.40: to see benefits in your own lifetime but 6548.40 - 6549.72: I think it really matters and many of 6549.72 - 6551.10: the figures I talk about were not even 6551.10 - 6553.98: well known in their time so you can make 6553.98 - 6556.74: a difference you do impart something 6556.74 - 6558.66: small in the universe that can grow into 6558.66 - 6560.10: something better and we shouldn't forget 6560.10 - 6562.20: that yeah that's why I admire a boxer 6562.20 - 6564.18: the horse I will work harder even if he 6564.18 - 6566.46: gets sent to the slaughter by the evil 6566.46 - 6567.54: pigs 6567.54 - 6569.78: you're on Orwell today I love how much 6569.78 - 6572.88: recently I mean uh animal farm is one of 6572.88 - 6575.04: my favorite my favorite books I've been 6575.04 - 6577.50: recently I've just I'm rereading 1984 6577.50 - 6579.90: now uh it's been politicized that book 6579.90 - 6581.52: in general yeah but to me it's a love 6581.52 - 6583.68: story it is a love story that there's uh 6583.68 - 6587.88: the like love is the like it's a story 6587.88 - 6589.74: of an oppressive government it's a real 6589.74 - 6591.96: estate and uh the nature of Truth being 6591.96 - 6595.92: manipulated by wartime so on but the the 6595.92 - 6599.46: Beacon of Hope in the human heart that 6599.46 - 6601.92: pulls you out that wakes you up in a 6601.92 - 6603.90: world like that is a love of another 6603.90 - 6606.30: human being it's Transcendence I totally 6606.30 - 6608.40: agree my understanding you would know 6608.40 - 6609.84: better than I would is that it's now a 6609.84 - 6612.06: best-selling book in Russia again 1984 6612.06 - 6613.50: yeah it's actually being downloaded more 6613.50 - 6615.60: there was a piece on NPR I heard about 6615.60 - 6618.18: this actually yeah yeah well I hope it's 6618.18 - 6619.56: because they're looking for love that's 6619.56 - 6621.30: what I was just gonna say hopefully not 6621.30 - 6623.22: in all the wrong places 6623.22 - 6625.14: hey there's no such thing as the wrong 6625.14 - 6627.66: places but that's that's my opinion I'm 6627.66 - 6629.22: the one that showed up naked and drunk 6629.22 - 6631.26: to your classroom I still surprised that 6631.26 - 6632.76: with you 6632.76 - 6635.46: I was wearing a wig I'm sorry uh quick 6635.46 - 6639.78: pause uh can I take a breath 6639.78 - 6643.08: and we're back uh John Wilkes Booth 6643.08 - 6645.96: assassinated Abraham Lincoln in his 6645.96 - 6648.06: diary as you write in your book he wrote 6648.06 - 6651.30: about Lincoln our country owed all her 6651.30 - 6654.18: troubles to him and God simply made me 6654.18 - 6656.82: the instrument of his punishment the 6656.82 - 6658.68: country is not what it was 6658.68 - 6660.84: uh what was the idea of the country that 6660.84 - 6663.24: John Wilkes Booth uh believed in he 6663.24 - 6664.98: talked about this country that just 6664.98 - 6666.78: constantly being repeated in his writing 6666.78 - 6669.84: for John Wilkes Booth and many other uh 6669.84 - 6671.16: people who were close to the southern 6671.16 - 6672.84: part of the country and the Confederacy 6672.84 - 6675.06: they believe the country should be a 6675.06 - 6677.88: democracy for white people abounded 6677.88 - 6681.90: democracy and uh Booth was horrified and 6681.90 - 6683.22: we have to empathize with it not 6683.22 - 6685.14: sympathize but recognize how how strange 6685.14 - 6687.00: it seemed to him that all of a sudden 6687.00 - 6689.10: those who were slaves were now Soldiers 6689.10 - 6690.48: with guns 6690.48 - 6693.36: and he was particularly offended when he 6693.36 - 6695.88: saw in Washington DC a group of 6695.88 - 6698.22: African-American Union Soldiers holding 6698.22 - 6700.26: Southern prisoners of War 6700.26 - 6702.36: and um the world was turned upside down 6702.36 - 6704.10: for him democracy for him he believed in 6704.10 - 6705.90: democracy but democracy for white people 6705.90 - 6710.16: and that justified uh mistreating black 6710.16 - 6712.98: people for him 6712.98 - 6717.18: it's a country means uh white white 6717.18 - 6719.28: people yeah and and I don't think it's 6719.28 - 6721.14: that different from 6721.14 - 6723.84: um and white Christians white Christians 6723.84 - 6726.24: yes yeah he was not arguing for Jewish 6726.24 - 6728.04: emancipation either 6728.04 - 6730.26: um I I I don't think that's really 6730.26 - 6731.40: different from what we've seen in the 6731.40 - 6733.68: 20th century for people who justify 6733.68 - 6735.66: ethnic cleansing or genocide 6735.66 - 6738.06: uh let's go to the you know the extreme 6738.06 - 6739.92: example of Hitler again uh that we've 6739.92 - 6741.66: talked about before 6741.66 - 6744.36: his view was actually he he claimed he 6744.36 - 6747.30: wanted a democracy for Germany he wanted 6747.30 - 6749.70: a democracy of the right Germans and he 6749.70 - 6752.16: wanted those who he saw infecting and 6752.16 - 6754.38: mongolizing the society out that's in 6754.38 - 6756.54: essence what John Wilkes Booth thought 6756.54 - 6758.94: the scary thing is those kinds of ideas 6758.94 - 6761.82: you can put a pretty face on them like 6761.82 - 6764.52: you don't have to use and maybe Hitler 6764.52 - 6766.92: didn't until the war started or even 6766.92 - 6770.40: parts of the war make it so clear that 6770.40 - 6772.62: you just want the certain kind of 6772.62 - 6774.96: Germans that have made Germany a great 6774.96 - 6777.18: nation to be the people that are running 6777.18 - 6779.64: that nation and other people who are not 6779.64 - 6781.74: truly interested in it don't hold the 6781.74 - 6783.60: interest of the country at heart like 6783.60 - 6785.16: they should go elsewhere where they can 6785.16 - 6787.50: flourish also is wonderful but like the 6787.50 - 6790.20: good Germans uh they've built all these 6790.20 - 6791.82: amazing things which should give them 6791.82 - 6793.86: the power and not to the others and you 6793.86 - 6795.72: can put a bunch of Flowery language 6795.72 - 6797.76: around that precisely it's the argument 6797.76 - 6799.26: that's made all the time today against 6799.26 - 6800.94: immigration 6800.94 - 6802.56: that the wrong people are coming into 6802.56 - 6804.84: our society it's ironic because it's 6804.84 - 6806.22: often made by those who themselves are 6806.22 - 6808.50: immigrants history teaches us that those 6808.50 - 6810.30: who have arrived as immigrants are no 6810.30 - 6811.92: more likely to like those who come in 6811.92 - 6813.06: fact they might be against the next 6813.06 - 6814.98: group for just this reason because they 6814.98 - 6816.86: think they're the right group can you 6816.86 - 6820.08: describe to me if it's useful at all to 6820.08 - 6821.58: know the difference 6821.58 - 6823.02: if there's a difference between white 6823.02 - 6826.04: nationalism white supremacists 6826.04 - 6828.98: and uh Christian nationalism 6828.98 - 6831.06: is there an intersection between them 6831.06 - 6833.88: I've heard these terms used oh 6833.88 - 6836.88: separatism too right that 6836.88 - 6838.56: um is there interesting distinction that 6838.56 - 6840.72: permeated that history that's the last 6840.72 - 6844.20: today I think um there's a long history 6844.20 - 6847.08: in the United States of a belief in 6847.08 - 6849.30: white supremacy and it's not unique to 6849.30 - 6850.68: the United States we actually inherit 6850.68 - 6854.22: this from Europe uh and white supremacy 6854.22 - 6857.46: is is the belief that uh for whatever 6857.46 - 6861.36: reason those with lighter color skin uh 6861.36 - 6863.42: usually of northern European extraction 6863.42 - 6866.46: uh are superior have more rights or the 6866.46 - 6868.50: better people to make decisions all 6868.50 - 6869.94: sorts of things and it's an aesthetic 6869.94 - 6871.80: judgment as much as it is a political 6871.80 - 6873.78: judgment and that gets embedded in our 6873.78 - 6876.60: society right we inherit that 6876.60 - 6878.82: um Christian nationalism 6878.82 - 6881.04: is the presumption that it's not just 6881.04 - 6883.26: your race but now it's also your 6883.26 - 6886.32: Christian belief and that is actually 6886.32 - 6888.24: relatively new there are little pieces 6888.24 - 6891.48: of that in our history but but many of 6891.48 - 6893.52: those who are white supremacists even 6893.52 - 6895.02: those in the Confederacy are not 6895.02 - 6897.78: Christian nationalists because they 6897.78 - 6899.34: don't agree on which kind of 6899.34 - 6901.32: Christianity and they don't view those 6901.32 - 6903.24: who are from a different denomination of 6903.24 - 6904.92: Christianity of being good Christians 6904.92 - 6907.14: there isn't this big tent Christianity 6907.14 - 6909.48: in the 19th century 6909.48 - 6911.46: um this notion that there is one 6911.46 - 6913.62: Christian Nation and that we're all part 6913.62 - 6916.20: of it that's actually really a 20th 6916.20 - 6918.48: century creation it precedes the 6918.48 - 6920.52: Evangelical movement but it's been made 6920.52 - 6922.80: even more popular but it would not make 6922.80 - 6924.90: sense to a Confederate to say we're a 6924.90 - 6926.64: right white Christian Nation it would 6926.64 - 6928.22: make sense to say we're a white 6928.22 - 6930.72: Protestant Nation because they didn't 6930.72 - 6932.58: consider Catholics good Christians or a 6932.58 - 6935.16: white Presbyterian Nation 6935.16 - 6937.98: um and so that's that's something new 6937.98 - 6940.38: and I think with particularly dangerous 6940.38 - 6942.00: about this notion of Christian 6942.00 - 6945.06: nationalism is it creates this false 6945.06 - 6947.04: history saying we've always been 6947.04 - 6948.66: together as Christians that's always how 6948.66 - 6950.52: we've denied I defined ourselves and 6950.52 - 6952.74: that's not accurate well one interesting 6952.74 - 6954.98: thing so I recently talked to 6954.98 - 6958.56: uh uh left leaning or maybe a far left 6958.56 - 6961.26: political streamer Named Destiny uh 6961.26 - 6962.46: Stephen Burnell I don't know if you're 6962.46 - 6965.76: familiar with him he uh he does uh live 6965.76 - 6967.62: streaming debates with people it's very 6967.62 - 6969.00: passionate I've heard of this my 6969.00 - 6970.22: students have told me I'm not actually 6970.22 - 6972.36: my students are always up on the most 6972.36 - 6974.58: hip things yes that is no the funny 6974.58 - 6976.80: thing about him he's already considered 6976.80 - 6978.36: like a boomer he's already the old 6978.36 - 6979.80: streamer because he's been doing it for 6979.80 - 6981.72: 10 years he's not the cool kids anymore 6981.72 - 6983.88: anyway he goes into some difficult 6983.88 - 6986.64: political territory and he actually had 6986.64 - 6989.22: a many conversation with Nick Fuentes 6989.22 - 6992.58: and he says I mean uh some of it is 6992.58 - 6995.72: humor but some of it is pretty dark uh 6995.72 - 6998.16: hard-hitting sort of criticism is he 6998.16 - 6999.78: says that anyone who claims to be a 6999.78 - 7002.84: Christian nationalist asks them if they 7002.84 - 7004.18: would rather 7004.18 - 7008.00: have a million people who are atheists 7008.00 - 7011.60: from Sweden who are white come or if you 7011.60 - 7014.84: would rather have a million uh people 7014.84 - 7018.14: from Africa who are Christian come and 7018.14 - 7020.30: the the truth comes out that this is a 7020.30 - 7022.16: very surface level this kind of idea of 7022.16 - 7023.90: Christian nationalism is still 7023.90 - 7027.62: underneath it is a deep racism uh like 7027.62 - 7029.18: hate your toes black people I think 7029.18 - 7030.80: that's I'm sure that's right I'm sure 7030.80 - 7032.18: that's right that's the sense I got into 7032.18 - 7035.12: it does not seem to have deep kind of uh 7035.12 - 7037.58: yeah like historical context to it it's 7037.58 - 7039.80: just it's just a different a rebranding 7039.80 - 7042.38: of the old kind of hate what I think is 7042.38 - 7043.82: important though in drawing this 7043.82 - 7045.68: distinction and why it really matters 7045.68 - 7048.80: beyond the history of it is someone like 7048.80 - 7049.82: Lincoln 7049.82 - 7052.58: quotes scripture all the time the second 7052.58 - 7054.68: inaugural is filled second inaugural 7054.68 - 7056.54: address the Gettysburg Address filled 7056.54 - 7058.16: with Biblical references 7058.16 - 7060.14: but he does it in a way that's not 7060.14 - 7063.08: Christian nationalist because he's using 7063.08 - 7065.48: the text to bring people together he's 7065.48 - 7067.88: using it as a fable of humanity 7067.88 - 7070.34: and you could say he's not open to 7070.34 - 7072.08: Islamic thinking he's ignorant of the 7072.08 - 7074.62: Islamic world but as a Jew I'm a Jew 7074.62 - 7077.66: reading and studying Lincoln I know he's 7077.66 - 7079.52: a Christian but I don't feel excluded 7079.52 - 7081.14: from his rhetoric 7081.14 - 7083.30: because I share that Bible 7083.30 - 7085.82: we have different views but I I don't 7085.82 - 7087.26: feel excluded it actually brings people 7087.26 - 7089.18: together the Christian nationalist 7089.18 - 7090.86: approach that we've seen in the 20th 7090.86 - 7092.54: century and especially in recent decades 7092.54 - 7095.30: is intended to divide people 7095.30 - 7097.04: it excludes Jews 7097.04 - 7099.38: it excludes Christians who don't 7099.38 - 7102.20: interpret Christianity their way and and 7102.20 - 7104.00: to say that's what we've always done is 7104.00 - 7106.22: an entire Distortion of our country 7106.22 - 7108.08: and it also hides why this is so 7108.08 - 7109.04: dangerous 7109.04 - 7111.14: insofar as Christianity matters to our 7111.14 - 7112.40: country it should be in the way Lincoln 7112.40 - 7114.98: uses it as a set of common texts that 7114.98 - 7117.44: many of us resonate with knowing that we 7117.44 - 7118.58: have different rituals and different 7118.58 - 7121.10: understandings not as a way to exclude 7121.10 - 7123.38: people and not as a cover for racism 7123.38 - 7125.12: which is what it is it's kind of 7125.12 - 7126.08: interesting that you could talk about 7126.08 - 7128.42: I've talked to a lot of people Muslim 7128.42 - 7130.76: folks uh Jewish folks Christian folks 7130.76 - 7132.20: there's a way to talk about religion 7132.20 - 7133.88: that's inclusive and then that's 7133.88 - 7137.12: exclusive I mean it's just been of these 7137.12 - 7138.74: I've been listening to a lot of these 7138.74 - 7140.84: Interfaith conversations and they're 7140.84 - 7141.80: awesome 7141.80 - 7143.60: they like celebrate the beauty of each 7143.60 - 7145.40: religion they banter and argue with each 7145.40 - 7147.32: other about details and so on but like 7147.32 - 7149.84: it feels like love like it feels like 7149.84 - 7152.66: anybody from any of those religions uh 7152.66 - 7154.58: would feel welcome at that party yeah 7154.58 - 7157.04: and I think that's possible 7157.04 - 7158.72: can you tell me about the disputed 7158.72 - 7161.78: election of 1876 so this is fascinating 7161.78 - 7164.12: the 1876 election is one of many 7164.12 - 7166.34: elections we've had some recently that 7166.34 - 7168.80: are intensely controversial uh and 7168.80 - 7170.24: they're controversial because they're so 7170.24 - 7171.14: close 7171.14 - 7172.64: they're controversial because it's not 7172.64 - 7174.32: always clear who's won 7174.32 - 7178.10: in 1876 uh Samuel Tilden the governor of 7178.10 - 7180.20: New York who's running as the Democratic 7180.20 - 7182.90: candidate wins more votes across the 7182.90 - 7183.92: country 7183.92 - 7185.54: so everyone knows he becomes president 7185.54 - 7187.40: right wrong he doesn't become president 7187.40 - 7190.28: because in three states South Carolina 7190.28 - 7193.16: Louisiana and Florida it's very very 7193.16 - 7194.48: close 7194.48 - 7196.52: and even though Tilden has more total 7196.52 - 7199.34: votes if he loses those States the 7199.34 - 7201.38: electors in those States all of which go 7201.38 - 7203.06: to the winner of the state would 7203.06 - 7204.92: actually make Rutherford B Hayes the 7204.92 - 7206.96: Republican candidate president in all 7206.96 - 7208.22: three of those States you also have 7208.22 - 7210.14: Republican Governors who have just lost 7210.14 - 7211.70: but are still the people who have to 7211.70 - 7213.44: certify the election 7213.44 - 7215.72: all three states say that hey is one 7215.72 - 7217.76: even though it's very close and disputed 7217.76 - 7221.18: so Hayes has one more electoral vote 7221.18 - 7222.38: of course the Democrats won't accept 7222.38 - 7225.92: that and so we go into February that the 7225.92 - 7227.42: inauguration was done in March not in 7227.42 - 7229.16: January we go from November to February 7229.16 - 7231.32: without clear agreement on who the 7231.32 - 7233.48: president is in the end there's an 7233.48 - 7236.12: agreement that they come to a deal which 7236.12 - 7237.98: is where the Democrats will accept Hayes 7237.98 - 7239.90: as president in return for Hayes doing 7239.90 - 7241.64: all the things the Democrats want in the 7241.64 - 7242.66: south 7242.66 - 7245.80: and so in essence you have a deal made 7245.80 - 7249.02: that one side will get all its all it 7249.02 - 7251.24: wants while allowing the other side to 7251.24 - 7252.62: have the figurehead 7252.62 - 7255.50: and so in a certain way this marks a 7255.50 - 7258.20: moment when the Confederacy wins 7258.20 - 7260.48: for example Hayes has to agree to pull 7260.48 - 7262.28: out all federal force from the south 7262.28 - 7264.62: which means there's no protection for 7264.62 - 7266.54: fair elections going forward and you'll 7266.54 - 7269.12: see in States like Mississippi uh the 7269.12 - 7271.18: number of African-American voters will 7271.18 - 7273.92: Decline and not recover again until the 7273.92 - 7276.80: late 20th century so that's what that 7276.80 - 7279.50: election does and from 1876 until 1896 7279.50 - 7280.94: we have a series of Elections that are 7280.94 - 7282.82: very close it happens also 7282.82 - 7287.00: in 1888 that the person with the most 7287.00 - 7288.62: popular vote loses that's Grover 7288.62 - 7291.74: Cleveland who loses to Benjamin Harrison 7291.74 - 7293.66: um and again we'll have the same issue 7293.66 - 7296.18: where there's a dispute and so what that 7296.18 - 7300.14: election shows us 1876 1888 is that our 7300.14 - 7301.40: election system and the problem of 7301.40 - 7302.78: having an electoral college really 7302.78 - 7304.40: complicates things and makes it harder 7304.40 - 7306.62: for us to come to any kind of consensus 7306.62 - 7308.78: any kind of agreement on who's won an 7308.78 - 7310.52: election super important for today 7310.52 - 7313.04: because most of the 20th century we 7313.04 - 7314.30: don't have close elections so it doesn't 7314.30 - 7316.28: matter when we come to a world today 7316.28 - 7318.02: where our elections are very close our 7318.02 - 7320.30: system is not well designed to deal with 7320.30 - 7322.94: those issues do you draw any parallels 7322.94 - 7325.58: uh with our time and what are some key 7325.58 - 7327.14: differences there's been contested 7327.14 - 7330.50: elections uh Florida Florida 7330.50 - 7332.84: with Al Gore and there's been just 7332.84 - 7334.82: contest election after contested 7334.82 - 7336.74: election and of course most famously 7336.74 - 7337.90: recently 7337.90 - 7340.76: uh with the the contested election that 7340.76 - 7344.66: led to uh January 6th so I think uh a 7344.66 - 7345.86: couple of parallels and a couple of 7345.86 - 7347.48: differences one parallel is that when 7347.48 - 7350.42: you have close elections uh the losing 7350.42 - 7351.86: side is never happy 7351.86 - 7353.54: it's a myth 7353.54 - 7355.22: that when you have a close election the 7355.22 - 7357.14: other side just accepts it and it's not 7357.14 - 7359.12: that doesn't happen and we need to be 7359.12 - 7360.44: attentive to that and ready for that 7360.44 - 7362.84: January 6th actually should surprise us 7362.84 - 7365.18: not because it happened but because it 7365.18 - 7367.34: hadn't happened before 7367.34 - 7369.44: um people who lose a close election are 7369.44 - 7370.76: never happy and they always think that 7370.76 - 7372.32: something has been done that's one 7372.32 - 7374.54: parallel second parallel is elections 7374.54 - 7375.74: are violent 7375.74 - 7377.60: we have this myth that our elections are 7377.60 - 7379.46: peaceful no there's always violence 7379.46 - 7381.20: involved in one way or another violence 7381.20 - 7382.88: in either trying to prevent people from 7382.88 - 7384.92: voting or violence and preventing people 7384.92 - 7387.52: from preventing people from voting right 7387.52 - 7390.38: elections are not uh peaceful walks in 7390.38 - 7392.66: the park and that's why most countries 7392.66 - 7395.66: have a centralized system to manage 7395.66 - 7397.28: elections and provide protection for 7397.28 - 7399.86: people uh we need to think about that a 7399.86 - 7401.30: lot of people don't vote because they're 7401.30 - 7402.44: afraid 7402.44 - 7403.70: they don't want to take the time but 7403.70 - 7404.78: they're also afraid that they're going 7404.78 - 7406.82: to anger someone or that they're going 7406.82 - 7408.52: to be seen as politicizing an issue 7408.52 - 7411.74: differences uh in 1876 there was fraud 7411.74 - 7414.14: in the election uh there were people who 7414.14 - 7415.58: voted two three times one of the things 7415.58 - 7418.04: the Ku Klux Klan did is it prevented 7418.04 - 7419.72: black people from voting and that it 7419.72 - 7421.04: helped white people go to multiple 7421.04 - 7422.54: voting booths 7422.54 - 7424.46: uh and this was quite common in the 7424.46 - 7427.04: 1880s if you went to vote uh here's how 7427.04 - 7428.48: it would happen in a place like Chicago 7428.48 - 7431.60: or New York the union boss from your 7431.60 - 7433.16: factory would come and get you at the 7433.16 - 7434.00: factory 7434.00 - 7436.64: give you lunch get you drunk and then 7436.64 - 7438.38: drive you from one voting booth to 7438.38 - 7439.94: another and give you a ballot that you 7439.94 - 7441.14: would bring in and just and he would 7441.14 - 7443.30: watch you deposit that ballot 7443.30 - 7446.30: sounds pretty nice not gonna lie I take 7446.30 - 7448.22: that right so that's a difference that 7448.22 - 7450.08: that is not how our elections work now 7450.08 - 7451.88: one of our Great accomplishments has 7451.88 - 7453.92: been to eliminate virtually all the 7453.92 - 7455.54: fraud in our elections how have we done 7455.54 - 7458.42: that by creating safeguards 7458.42 - 7461.66: um it is very difficult all the evidence 7461.66 - 7463.70: we have is that the minimal fraud that's 7463.70 - 7465.20: occurred in elections or onesies and 7465.20 - 7467.84: twosies and it's never in the last 20 7467.84 - 7469.58: years had any big difference in the 7469.58 - 7471.26: outcome of Elections so that's a that's 7471.26 - 7473.06: a big difference and then another big 7473.06 - 7476.30: difference I think is that um in that 7476.30 - 7478.34: time the Democrats and Republicans are 7478.34 - 7479.78: on the opposite sides of where they are 7479.78 - 7481.34: now and that that changes everything 7481.34 - 7482.78: right so the Democrats then are the 7482.78 - 7485.18: party of the Confederacy the Democrats 7485.18 - 7486.56: are the party of exclusion the 7486.56 - 7487.88: Republicans are more the party of 7487.88 - 7489.62: economic expansion 7489.62 - 7492.14: uh and the Republicans are the Big Ten 7492.14 - 7494.78: party were reversed today do you think 7494.78 - 7497.54: uh because there's much less election 7497.54 - 7499.10: fraud 7499.10 - 7501.50: now like you described 7501.50 - 7503.90: uh one of the lessons we want to maybe 7503.90 - 7506.00: learn from that is that doesn't actually 7506.00 - 7508.22: have to be election fraud for either 7508.22 - 7510.50: side to claim this election fraud it 7510.50 - 7513.08: seems like it's more and more common and 7513.08 - 7516.14: it seems to me that in 2024 election in 7516.14 - 7518.90: the United States if a republican wins 7518.90 - 7523.00: that would also be uh 7523.00 - 7527.24: just maybe just as likely as as uh 7527.24 - 7530.06: um if uh if a Democrat wins that there 7530.06 - 7531.28: would be 7531.28 - 7535.52: nuanced claims of election fraud 7535.52 - 7537.32: because it's become more and more 7537.32 - 7539.06: normalized I think what the what this 7539.06 - 7540.86: history shows is that our election 7540.86 - 7543.50: system makes it easy for people to claim 7543.50 - 7545.42: fraud because it's so unnecessarily 7545.42 - 7546.80: complex 7546.80 - 7548.66: first of all we don't have a system 7548.66 - 7550.10: where the person who gets the most votes 7550.10 - 7551.84: is necessarily the winner so that 7551.84 - 7553.52: already creates one problem second 7553.52 - 7555.08: problem is everything I taught about 7555.08 - 7556.88: this in the book is controlled at the 7556.88 - 7558.08: county level 7558.08 - 7560.60: so what happens with Haze until then in 7560.60 - 7563.18: 1876 is you have one County official who 7563.18 - 7564.68: says they think one person one another 7564.68 - 7566.12: County official thinks says the other 7566.12 - 7568.42: person won there's no centralized system 7568.42 - 7571.22: uh it would be as if we allowed every 7571.22 - 7573.20: airport to control safety in airplanes 7573.20 - 7574.52: our airplanes would not be safe our 7574.52 - 7576.02: airplanes are safe because the FAA and 7576.02 - 7577.40: the national Transportation safety board 7577.40 - 7580.28: have strict Universal guidelines for 7580.28 - 7581.84: what makes for a safe plan and therefore 7581.84 - 7583.22: our planes generally don't fall out of 7583.22 - 7586.82: the sky our system is very complex it 7586.82 - 7588.32: has complex rules and has too many 7588.32 - 7589.88: people who have authority in too many 7589.88 - 7592.70: different places complexity makes it 7592.70 - 7594.26: easier for someone to make an argument 7594.26 - 7596.30: that the wrong thing has been done we 7596.30 - 7598.16: should simplify the system in Brazil 7598.16 - 7600.22: they had a very close election 7600.22 - 7603.26: and uh it's very hard for bolsonaro who 7603.26 - 7604.82: lost that close election to claim there 7604.82 - 7606.50: was fraud because there's a central 7606.50 - 7608.12: Authority run by the Judiciary that 7608.12 - 7609.92: counted the votes and it's just simple 7609.92 - 7612.20: it's not about which states it's not 7612.20 - 7613.94: about who the county officials were did 7613.94 - 7616.52: he claim or no he has not acknowledged 7616.52 - 7619.46: that he lost right so to push back on 7619.46 - 7622.04: your on your statement undefeated 7622.04 - 7624.20: Monopoly and risk because anytime I lose 7624.20 - 7627.86: I walk away claim claiming there was 7627.86 - 7630.26: fraud and cheating involved and I refuse 7630.26 - 7631.94: to believe otherwise I just think that 7631.94 - 7633.16: uh 7633.16 - 7635.60: accusations of fraud is a narrative 7635.60 - 7637.82: that's disjoint from the reality of 7637.82 - 7639.92: whether there was enough yeah yeah I 7639.92 - 7641.54: agree but I think we make it we we make 7641.54 - 7642.86: it a little easier for that narrative 7642.86 - 7645.02: sure by having a complex convoluted 7645.02 - 7647.06: system and I wonder if there's other 7647.06 - 7648.92: improvements that take us into the 21st 7648.92 - 7650.78: century that allow for electronic voting 7650.78 - 7652.46: there's all kinds of improvements that 7652.46 - 7654.14: are seems our system is dragging their 7654.14 - 7656.72: feet on uh ranked just voting all that 7656.72 - 7659.06: kind of stuff let's make this clear we 7659.06 - 7660.74: claim to be the greatest 21st century 7660.74 - 7662.60: democracy and we still vote like the 7662.60 - 7664.58: 19th century we're not even in the 20th 7664.58 - 7666.32: century most people when they went to 7666.32 - 7669.62: vote they actually like you know checked 7669.62 - 7672.38: a box and put a piece of paper in a box 7672.38 - 7675.44: right I mean that's not 21st century we 7675.44 - 7677.36: can move millions of dollars maybe 7677.36 - 7680.42: billions for you Lex in bank accounts 7680.42 - 7682.46: from from our keyboard thank you for 7682.46 - 7684.82: from our keyboards billions of rubles 7684.82 - 7688.34: billions of pennies pennies uh why can 7688.34 - 7690.62: we move money safely and not vote in the 7690.62 - 7692.30: same way yeah and at the same time so 7692.30 - 7694.04: there's security there in the movement 7694.04 - 7695.96: of money and then there's the actual 7695.96 - 7698.18: engagement most of us depending on your 7698.18 - 7701.36: age demographic uh click like on 7701.36 - 7705.38: Facebook or Twitter or Tick Tock uh tens 7705.38 - 7708.20: of thousands of times a year uh I think 7708.20 - 7709.94: I think this kind of mechanism 7709.94 - 7712.58: constantly and a like is a vote so 7712.58 - 7713.90: you're constantly voting voting voting 7713.90 - 7716.36: voting we love voting we love giving our 7716.36 - 7718.16: opinion on that stuff it just seems 7718.16 - 7720.44: obvious that uh gamifying this system 7720.44 - 7722.00: which is essentially what the election 7722.00 - 7724.16: is making it fun to be engaged in 7724.16 - 7726.02: different issues and there's also be a 7726.02 - 7727.28: case 7727.28 - 7728.54: um no I don't understand these things 7728.54 - 7730.82: deeply but it always seemed to me that 7730.82 - 7732.68: issue-based voting 7732.68 - 7735.02: should be the future it seems like too 7735.02 - 7737.36: complicated to vote for singular people 7737.36 - 7739.88: versus on ideas which you know on 7739.88 - 7742.04: Twitter we don't necessarily vote for 7742.04 - 7743.96: people we vote for ideas if you like a 7743.96 - 7746.72: tweet or not you like it and so on 7746.72 - 7748.40: um that too seems to be like a 7748.40 - 7749.78: possibility for improvement well there's 7749.78 - 7751.46: certainly a way to improve polling we 7751.46 - 7752.96: could measure public opinion better we 7752.96 - 7755.18: still pull as if we're in the early 20th 7755.18 - 7756.98: century they still actually call people 7756.98 - 7759.44: it's amazing to me I was talking to one 7759.44 - 7761.66: pollster they uh will call a hundred 7761.66 - 7763.64: people and get one person but they still 7763.64 - 7765.68: do that that makes no call landlines 7765.68 - 7767.96: right uh yeah well they try to get cell 7767.96 - 7769.16: phones too they but they do call 7769.16 - 7771.44: landlines but one could create a system 7771.44 - 7772.88: that would be far better in the way 7772.88 - 7775.16: you're describing it seems to me Lex to 7775.16 - 7776.78: actually assess what people like and 7776.78 - 7777.92: don't like 7777.92 - 7781.76: so your book your work in general your 7781.76 - 7785.06: perspective on history is uh I would say 7785.06 - 7786.20: at least from my perspective 7786.20 - 7788.90: non-partisan thank you yeah you do 7788.90 - 7790.66: exceptionally good job of that uh 7790.66 - 7792.80: despite the attacks and the criticisms 7792.80 - 7795.08: that said you personally just the way 7795.08 - 7797.12: you speak my judgment and you can push 7797.12 - 7799.46: back on this I think you leave lean left 7799.46 - 7801.32: in your politics on the political 7801.32 - 7802.94: Spectrum maybe you can push back on that 7802.94 - 7805.40: can you make the case for either 7805.40 - 7808.04: perspective on your own personality as a 7808.04 - 7810.86: fan of yours that uh that you do lean 7810.86 - 7813.20: left or you don't lean left I think it 7813.20 - 7814.70: depends on the kinds of issues we're 7814.70 - 7817.04: talking about I do tend to lean left on 7817.04 - 7819.38: the social and cultural issues yes so 7819.38 - 7822.62: I'm a Believer a firm believer uh I 7822.62 - 7823.82: didn't believe this when I was younger 7823.82 - 7826.40: I've come to believe that uh people 7826.40 - 7828.02: should choose their own lifestyle and 7828.02 - 7830.00: that we should get out of the way I'm a 7830.00 - 7832.16: Believer deep believer as a father of a 7832.16 - 7835.28: 20 year old woman that my 20 year old 7835.28 - 7836.24: daughter should have the right to make 7836.24 - 7838.16: any choice she wants with her body 7838.16 - 7841.52: uh and if she were to get pregnant at a 7841.52 - 7844.40: fraternity party at College uh she 7844.40 - 7845.90: should have the right to decide whether 7845.90 - 7847.34: to have a child or not so on those 7847.34 - 7850.34: issues that would code me left left of 7850.34 - 7853.60: center uh I'm actually reasonably 7853.60 - 7856.34: conservative on fiscal issues 7856.34 - 7858.14: I don't think we should spend money we 7858.14 - 7859.40: don't have 7859.40 - 7861.80: uh I'm skeptical I've long been 7861.80 - 7863.60: skeptical of cryptocurrency and things 7863.60 - 7864.80: like that I know some of your listeners 7864.80 - 7866.18: will disagree with me this part is part 7866.18 - 7867.74: of my own ignorance of cryptocurrency 7867.74 - 7870.44: but I'm conservative lowercase C and the 7870.44 - 7872.12: way I think about fiscal issues I worry 7872.12 - 7873.32: about that 7873.32 - 7875.84: I am a believer that there are certain 7875.84 - 7876.98: areas where the federal government 7876.98 - 7878.72: should play more of a role 7878.72 - 7880.34: and there are other areas where things 7880.34 - 7882.20: should be left to the localities and so 7882.20 - 7884.06: sometimes that can code me one way or 7884.06 - 7886.22: another but I think I sound sometimes a 7886.22 - 7887.36: little more left or Center because on 7887.36 - 7889.10: the social issues like definitely well 7889.10 - 7890.60: that because well I mean there's other 7890.60 - 7892.52: explanations not to be grilling you too 7892.52 - 7895.16: hard no it's fair uh because you're also 7895.16 - 7897.68: an exceptionally uh respected and 7897.68 - 7899.12: successful professor in the University 7899.12 - 7903.14: system where sometimes there is a lean 7903.14 - 7905.72: towards the left and the other aspect is 7905.72 - 7908.14: I think your viewpoints on Trump 7908.14 - 7911.30: uh where you're a strong critic yes 7911.30 - 7912.56: Donald Trump yes 7912.56 - 7914.30: and I guess the question I want to ask 7914.30 - 7917.42: is you as a historian does that color 7917.42 - 7919.58: your perspective of History 7919.58 - 7923.48: can you do you ever catch yourself where 7923.48 - 7926.92: maybe your uh criticism of Donald Trump 7926.92 - 7929.60: might affect how you see the Civil War 7929.60 - 7932.42: like as you were completely diving in 7932.42 - 7934.94: and looking at the Civil War are you 7934.94 - 7938.48: able to put aside your uh sort of the 7938.48 - 7941.24: current day political viewpoints no I'm 7941.24 - 7942.74: not I think we have to be honest that 7942.74 - 7945.56: none of us are objective we strive to be 7945.56 - 7947.00: nonpartisan I really liked when you said 7947.00 - 7949.06: that because I think it's an aspiration 7949.06 - 7952.46: no one is objective we all have our 7952.46 - 7954.26: biases you know some people like 7954.26 - 7956.60: chocolate some like vanilla and it's 7956.60 - 7959.30: just that's just the reality right and 7959.30 - 7960.74: um as far as I know there's really hard 7960.74 - 7962.42: it's very hard even to biologically 7962.42 - 7965.18: explain that and so 7965.18 - 7966.80: um my view 7966.80 - 7968.72: is that what a good historian what a 7968.72 - 7969.92: good scholar does I don't care what the 7969.92 - 7972.32: field is is you're self-conscious of 7972.32 - 7973.84: your biases 7973.84 - 7978.02: and you try to recognize them as you're 7978.02 - 7979.58: doing your research 7979.58 - 7982.34: and you make doubly certain that where 7982.34 - 7983.96: your research seems to reinforce your 7983.96 - 7985.76: biases that you actually have the 7985.76 - 7987.74: evidence to make that argument 7987.74 - 7990.38: but I still believe even doing that that 7990.38 - 7991.58: someone with a slightly different 7991.58 - 7993.38: perspective might read the same evidence 7993.38 - 7995.24: in different ways that's what makes 7995.24 - 7996.62: history vibrant 7996.62 - 7999.14: so I I wrote this book in part as I say 7999.14 - 8001.78: in the introduction because I was 8001.78 - 8003.76: self-critical watching Trump and the 8003.76 - 8006.28: things I quite frankly find deeply 8006.28 - 8008.20: dangerous about Donald Trump and about 8008.20 - 8010.48: what happened on January 6th and I found 8010.48 - 8013.06: I had not thought deeply enough about 8013.06 - 8015.28: the roots of that in our society 8015.28 - 8017.14: because I don't believe Trump or any one 8017.14 - 8019.00: figure creates these kinds of movements 8019.00 - 8020.98: that come out of a deeper history uh 8020.98 - 8023.74: just a small side tangent I do believe 8023.74 - 8027.34: your work is non-partisan but it's also 8027.34 - 8028.60: funny 8028.60 - 8030.40: that there are a lot of people on the 8030.40 - 8032.02: right that would read your work and say 8032.02 - 8034.66: that you're partisan and I think I think 8034.66 - 8036.40: the reason that can happen sometimes not 8036.40 - 8038.20: strongly though I think you do a really 8038.20 - 8040.96: good job uh is like certain the use of 8040.96 - 8044.86: certain words also uh that I try to be 8044.86 - 8047.10: cognizant of that I try not to use words 8047.10 - 8052.06: that trigger people's uh tribalism it's 8052.06 - 8053.32: kind of interesting so you have to be 8053.32 - 8054.76: also aware of that maybe when you're 8054.76 - 8056.08: writing history when you're writing in 8056.08 - 8058.18: general is if if you're interested in 8058.18 - 8060.70: remaining you can put on different hats 8060.70 - 8063.22: you can be carefree and just stay in 8063.22 - 8065.44: your opinion of criticizing Donald Trump 8065.44 - 8068.86: or or Joe Biden uh or you can be 8068.86 - 8070.96: nonpartisan deliberately and that takes 8070.96 - 8073.30: skill probably and avoiding certain 8073.30 - 8074.92: triggering words and to me it's about 8074.92 - 8077.86: choosing your battles right so I tried 8077.86 - 8079.18: to write 8079.18 - 8080.80: because I want everyone to read and I 8080.80 - 8082.60: actually think people on the left and 8082.60 - 8083.68: right have a lot to learn from this 8083.68 - 8085.00: history so many people have said to me 8085.00 - 8086.62: around the country this is history I 8086.62 - 8088.90: wish I had known before 8088.90 - 8091.30: um but there are moments when I use 8091.30 - 8092.56: words that I know are controversial 8092.56 - 8094.00: because I'm trying to show there's a 8094.00 - 8097.30: fact base behind them so white supremacy 8097.30 - 8099.04: does exist I've had people say I don't 8099.04 - 8100.60: think that's I think that's a 8100.60 - 8102.46: politically correct term or it's a woke 8102.46 - 8105.10: term it can be used in the wrong ways 8105.10 - 8106.60: one should not go around calling 8106.60 - 8109.60: everything one doesn't like that uh but 8109.60 - 8111.70: the Confederates were white supremacists 8111.70 - 8114.16: and I use that word because I think it's 8114.16 - 8116.08: an accurate descriptor and we need to 8116.08 - 8118.66: recognize that that is a part of our 8118.66 - 8120.16: history but that does trigger some 8120.16 - 8123.22: people and because that that language is 8123.22 - 8125.68: used to mean other things currently so 8125.68 - 8127.66: the the Press will take on certain terms 8127.66 - 8129.04: like white supremacists then label 8129.04 - 8132.10: everybody white supremacist uh like a 8132.10 - 8133.48: lot of people that basically are in the 8133.48 - 8134.74: right or something like that they use 8134.74 - 8137.68: this outraged language and that actually 8137.68 - 8139.36: ruins the ability to use the language 8139.36 - 8142.66: precisely exactly for historical that's 8142.66 - 8144.46: exactly right that's exactly but you do 8144.46 - 8146.86: have to unfortunately we do have to no 8146.86 - 8148.18: actually people disagree you might 8148.18 - 8151.18: disagree with this but I I tend to try 8151.18 - 8153.10: to avoid like take on the responsibility 8153.10 - 8155.38: avoiding that language 8155.38 - 8157.06: um like if the Press is using a certain 8157.06 - 8158.86: kind of language I try to avoid it yeah 8158.86 - 8160.84: what might what I try to do is sometimes 8160.84 - 8162.10: avoid it but where I think the language 8162.10 - 8164.74: is necessary yeah to be precise but also 8164.74 - 8166.60: to contextualize 8166.60 - 8169.72: so I don't call the confeder all 8169.72 - 8171.76: Confederates white supremacists but I 8171.76 - 8174.70: point out where white supremacist ideas 8174.70 - 8176.38: have influenced them 8176.38 - 8178.06: right and I point out where certain 8178.06 - 8179.38: individuals are doing things that 8179.38 - 8181.60: resonate with that but I'm against these 8181.60 - 8184.18: kind of blanket labels and categories 8184.18 - 8187.44: and you also have to speak about Vice 8187.44 - 8190.48: supremacism in that context in a nuanced 8190.48 - 8192.46: way so people use white supremacist 8192.46 - 8193.90: without thinking what that means and 8193.90 - 8195.82: they just use it as a slower word like 8195.82 - 8198.52: this evil person but white supremacist 8198.52 - 8200.80: is also just an ideology that a lot of 8200.80 - 8201.88: people have believed throughout 8201.88 - 8204.10: Supremacy what a white 8204.10 - 8207.34: black Supremacy whatever Supremacy uh 8207.34 - 8208.54: believing that some people are better 8208.54 - 8209.92: than others some group is better than 8209.92 - 8212.80: another and there's been Nations built 8212.80 - 8215.68: around these kinds of ideas and a lot of 8215.68 - 8216.88: human history is built around those 8216.88 - 8219.10: ideas it's not just evil people believe 8219.10 - 8221.14: in this we in in the United States of 8221.14 - 8223.42: America believe this kind of ideology is 8223.42 - 8227.14: not productive it's unethical but those 8227.14 - 8228.82: ideas have been held by a lot of people 8228.82 - 8232.92: and not like Fringe groups right uh but 8232.92 - 8235.36: majorities of Nations right I'd say the 8235.36 - 8237.10: same about anti-semitism 8237.10 - 8238.96: and there are many people who are not 8238.96 - 8242.14: anti-semites but don't recognize that 8242.14 - 8244.24: they're carrying around or promoting 8244.24 - 8247.00: anti-semitic ideas or anti-semitic myths 8247.00 - 8248.68: is the thought that's been held by a lot 8248.68 - 8250.42: of people and you need to be convinced 8250.42 - 8252.10: out of it 8252.10 - 8254.56: um that that requires conversation and 8254.56 - 8256.00: being empathetic 8256.00 - 8257.86: it's not just calling somebody 8257.86 - 8259.72: anti-semite and you're evil because if 8259.72 - 8262.06: you've ever said something that's kind 8262.06 - 8263.82: of a dog whistle against Jewish people 8263.82 - 8265.90: you have to be open-hearted to that 8265.90 - 8267.46: these These are ideas that you have to 8267.46 - 8270.52: contend with that that you have to 8270.52 - 8272.68: um ultimately I think 8272.68 - 8275.32: Heal The Division behind those ideas by 8275.32 - 8277.12: having empathetic conversations with 8277.12 - 8280.00: people as opposed to again throwing poop 8280.00 - 8283.78: I just like saying poop all right oh I 8283.78 - 8285.46: got a challenge for you 8285.46 - 8287.62: given that you uh 8287.62 - 8290.14: have been an outspoken critic of Donald 8290.14 - 8290.92: Trump 8290.92 - 8293.68: can you say one thing you like and one 8293.68 - 8295.60: thing you don't like about Donald Trump 8295.60 - 8298.90: and perhaps can you do the same for our 8298.90 - 8300.94: current President Joe Biden one thing 8300.94 - 8302.74: you like when you think you dislike so 8302.74 - 8304.12: it's harder for me to do the one thing I 8304.12 - 8305.56: dislike because there's so many things I 8305.56 - 8308.14: dislike but the one thing I like uh 8308.14 - 8311.62: about uh Donald Trump 8311.62 - 8313.06: um 8313.06 - 8316.48: he believes that um 8316.48 - 8318.16: America 8318.16 - 8320.56: should be a better country he I disagree 8320.56 - 8322.90: on what he thinks it should be but he's 8322.90 - 8324.46: not someone he's not a declinist he's 8324.46 - 8325.72: someone who believes the world could be 8325.72 - 8327.64: made better I disagree with what he's 8327.64 - 8328.78: trying to do I disagree with how he's 8328.78 - 8330.70: trying to do it but I like the fact that 8330.70 - 8332.08: he thinks it can be better his whole 8332.08 - 8334.00: argument for himself is that he can make 8334.00 - 8336.10: things better I don't think he can but I 8336.10 - 8337.60: think things can be made better so I 8337.60 - 8338.92: like the second half of that sentence 8338.92 - 8340.24: when he says I can make things better 8340.24 - 8342.46: take the eye out I like that can be 8342.46 - 8343.66: better because there are too many people 8343.66 - 8345.76: on the left and the right 8345.76 - 8348.22: who think that the you know that we 8348.22 - 8349.30: can't make things better we have to 8349.30 - 8350.62: accept them as they are or they're 8350.62 - 8353.14: getting worse uh I I think a world 8353.14 - 8354.76: without hope is horrible and I think 8354.76 - 8357.22: what he has offered his followers is a 8357.22 - 8360.70: kind of hope so underneath his message 8360.70 - 8364.12: is an a kind of optimism for the future 8364.12 - 8365.44: of this nation yeah it's a narcissistic 8365.44 - 8367.36: optimism but it's still an optimism yes 8367.36 - 8370.36: that that he he's promising that if you 8370.36 - 8373.24: elect him again he will make things 8373.24 - 8374.50: better 8374.50 - 8376.90: and I think people need to be told and 8376.90 - 8378.16: we need to believe that we can make 8378.16 - 8379.90: things better so that part I accept and 8379.90 - 8382.36: I reject those who say 8382.36 - 8383.92: we can't make things better my whole 8383.92 - 8385.18: historical career is about showing that 8385.18 - 8386.98: history gives us tools to make things 8386.98 - 8387.94: better 8387.94 - 8391.12: so I like the idea of trying to make 8391.12 - 8393.04: things better and giving people hope and 8393.04 - 8394.96: reason to believe that things can be 8394.96 - 8396.88: better what's the main thing you dislike 8396.88 - 8400.96: about Donald Trump I I think he has uh 8400.96 - 8404.14: no concern or care for the welfare of 8404.14 - 8406.00: anyone other than himself 8406.00 - 8408.52: so assuming I'm a basic human psychology 8408.52 - 8411.54: perspective 8411.54 - 8413.62: and I I think he doesn't even care about 8413.62 - 8415.30: his children I think he's just I think 8415.30 - 8417.76: it's it's him I think he's gone into a 8417.76 - 8419.08: rap and Holly might not always have been 8419.08 - 8421.00: this way I did watch him a long time in 8421.00 - 8422.68: New York City when I was growing up in 8422.68 - 8424.60: New York and I think he's been in this 8424.60 - 8426.64: path and I think it's an extreme it's a 8426.64 - 8429.16: clinical kind of narcissism 8429.16 - 8431.44: so do you when you analyze presidents 8431.44 - 8433.36: and you've written about presidents you 8433.36 - 8435.16: don't just look at policies and so on 8435.16 - 8436.42: you look at the human being of course 8436.42 - 8437.32: you have to 8437.32 - 8439.12: leadership is about human being policy 8439.12 - 8440.56: matters it's one part of the equation 8440.56 - 8443.20: but it's not the only part what about uh 8443.20 - 8445.30: Joe Biden uh what do you like and what 8445.30 - 8446.74: do you dislike about so what I like 8446.74 - 8449.80: about Joe Biden is in contrast to Trump 8449.80 - 8451.96: I think Joe Biden really right now in 8451.96 - 8453.16: his career 8453.16 - 8455.14: sees his role as The Shepherd of 8455.14 - 8457.72: democracy he really believes that it's 8457.72 - 8459.10: his role as president to make our 8459.10 - 8460.90: democracy more stable 8460.90 - 8463.78: and more vibrant I think he really 8463.78 - 8464.98: believes I think that's why he's doing 8464.98 - 8467.32: what he's doing right now and he comes 8467.32 - 8469.08: from that system the political system 8469.08 - 8472.30: that basically the the process of 8472.30 - 8473.80: democracies he's worked there for many 8473.80 - 8475.60: decades it's all he's done yeah that's 8475.60 - 8478.12: all he knows that he and he wants that 8478.12 - 8479.92: to propagate For Better or For Worse and 8479.92 - 8481.60: he's not an extreme Democratic partisan 8481.60 - 8483.40: at all he's actually he's actually a 8483.40 - 8484.84: pretty middle-of-the-road guy on most 8484.84 - 8486.82: issues um some people don't like him for 8486.82 - 8489.04: that but I think he is about he is about 8489.04 - 8490.48: democracy 8490.48 - 8493.48: um what do I dislike about Biden I think 8493.48 - 8496.30: he does not have the capacity 8496.30 - 8500.38: right now to provide the language and 8500.38 - 8503.56: the public discussion of where our 8503.56 - 8505.00: country should go 8505.00 - 8507.34: he doesn't have a he doesn't have a 8507.34 - 8510.90: language to inspire and build 8510.90 - 8513.76: enthusiasm for the future 8513.76 - 8516.22: that'll probably be one of my I mean 8516.22 - 8517.66: because I'm a sucker for great speeches 8517.66 - 8520.72: and so for me that's definitely a thing 8520.72 - 8523.60: that stands out for several reasons one 8523.60 - 8526.42: in a time because we've been facing so 8526.42 - 8528.52: many challenges like the pandemic 8528.52 - 8531.34: it just seems like a like to me it seems 8531.34 - 8534.52: like an easy like layout 8534.52 - 8536.74: there's so many troubles we're going 8536.74 - 8538.66: through that just require a great 8538.66 - 8540.82: unifying president or the great like 8540.82 - 8543.76: just if I were to speak uh candidly 8543.76 - 8545.98: about kind of the the speaking ability 8545.98 - 8548.68: of Obama for example Obama would just 8548.68 - 8551.14: destroy this right now both on the war 8551.14 - 8554.44: in Ukraine on the pandemic all of it the 8554.44 - 8556.66: unified there's a hunger for unification 8556.66 - 8558.76: I believe maybe people disagree with 8558.76 - 8561.40: that because they've they've I think 8561.40 - 8562.96: people have become cynical in that the 8562.96 - 8564.70: divisions that we're experiencing are 8564.70 - 8567.70: kind of already really baked in they're 8567.70 - 8569.44: really they're really planted their feet 8569.44 - 8570.76: but I don't think so I think there's a 8570.76 - 8572.50: huge hunger maybe a little bit of a 8572.50 - 8575.02: quiet hunger for a unifier for a great 8575.02 - 8577.18: unifier I agree I agree and I think 8577.18 - 8578.98: what's what a great speech does is it's 8578.98 - 8582.04: like a great piece of music or poetry it 8582.04 - 8584.20: helps you see something in yourself and 8584.20 - 8586.72: feel something you didn't feel before it 8586.72 - 8588.22: doesn't overcome all different I don't 8588.22 - 8590.26: think that speeches are unifying but I 8590.26 - 8590.98: think what they are is they're 8590.98 - 8593.38: mobilizing and you can mobilize people 8593.38 - 8595.60: to the same mission with different 8595.60 - 8599.50: points of view 8599.50 - 8601.78: do you think Trump derangement syndrome 8601.78 - 8603.70: is a medical condition 8603.70 - 8605.92: um also is there such thing as uh Biden 8605.92 - 8607.90: derangement syndrome what I mean by that 8607.90 - 8610.72: I said it's a it's a funny kind of 8610.72 - 8613.72: question but why are people so deeply 8613.72 - 8615.04: outraged 8615.04 - 8619.00: seemingly Beyond Reason at their hatred 8619.00 - 8621.64: or support of Donald Trump but hatred in 8621.64 - 8624.04: particular I've seen a lot of friends 8624.04 - 8625.84: and people I respect 8625.84 - 8629.08: like lose their mind completely yeah 8629.08 - 8631.00: so I'm not sure it's a medical condition 8631.00 - 8633.58: or not because I'm not a medical doctor 8633.58 - 8635.80: so I you know my kids say I'm the wrong 8635.80 - 8637.84: guy in the doctor I'm I'm a doctor so 8637.84 - 8640.72: let me take you from here no uh P the 8640.72 - 8642.34: fact that you get the doctor sign after 8642.34 - 8644.38: getting a PhD is a ridiculous hilarity 8644.38 - 8647.02: to me hilarious ridiculous so as as the 8647.02 - 8648.76: wrong kind of doctor I'll say I'm not 8648.76 - 8649.72: going to comment on whether it's a 8649.72 - 8650.98: medical condition but I do think you're 8650.98 - 8652.48: on to something 8652.48 - 8655.78: um I think there is a way in which 8655.78 - 8659.82: um these men become 8659.82 - 8663.28: touchstones of anger and there's all 8663.28 - 8665.20: kinds of anger and anxiety that people 8665.20 - 8666.10: have 8666.10 - 8667.72: and I've seen this in other historical 8667.72 - 8672.24: periods you you Center it on one person 8672.24 - 8674.80: uh in a way that's John Wilkes Booth in 8674.80 - 8676.00: Lincoln 8676.00 - 8677.38: he actually didn't have a personal beef 8677.38 - 8678.52: with Lincoln 8678.52 - 8681.04: it was that all the things he feared 8681.04 - 8684.94: were were manifest uh in that and I 8684.94 - 8687.34: think that's an old story and then it's 8687.34 - 8689.26: made worse by social media 8689.26 - 8691.42: and the way we're bombarded and it's 8691.42 - 8692.68: it's like 8692.68 - 8694.54: it becomes a drug I mean they're people 8694.54 - 8697.12: I know who hate Trump or Biden so much 8697.12 - 8698.68: and just watch them 8698.68 - 8700.06: it's not that they don't watch them it's 8700.06 - 8701.50: that they do watch them right and it's 8701.50 - 8703.60: just sort of and it triggers you and and 8703.60 - 8706.00: you get hateful and then you feel like 8706.00 - 8708.04: you've done something by shouting out 8708.04 - 8710.80: your hate or typing in and and so I 8710.80 - 8711.76: don't know if it's a derangement 8711.76 - 8713.74: syndrome I think it's a it's a way in 8713.74 - 8716.14: which our energy gets channeled and 8716.14 - 8719.26: expressed in totally useless ways yeah 8719.26 - 8721.48: that's an interesting psychology which 8721.48 - 8723.04: reminds me I need to explore that 8723.04 - 8724.84: because I've noticed that believe it or 8724.84 - 8727.12: not it's easy for me to believe but 8727.12 - 8728.98: there's people watching this right now 8728.98 - 8731.14: who really hate me 8731.14 - 8732.82: and they're watching because they hate 8732.82 - 8735.10: me they hate the way I look the way the 8735.10 - 8737.50: way I speak the mumbling the all of that 8737.50 - 8740.50: and they're still watching and I'd like 8740.50 - 8744.46: to say that as I nervously try to 8744.46 - 8746.68: explain myself I like to say that that's 8746.68 - 8750.22: not a productive way I get it 8750.22 - 8752.50: I understand there's a kind of because 8752.50 - 8753.88: because I 8753.88 - 8755.92: what is it it's this is it the same 8755.92 - 8757.84: psychological effect when you see a car 8757.84 - 8759.46: crash and you keep staring yeah it's 8759.46 - 8760.84: some kind of thing that pulls you in 8760.84 - 8763.60: totally but I feel like it's that 8763.60 - 8765.76: feeling what this is probably slightly 8765.76 - 8768.40: different but you kind of want to you 8768.40 - 8770.08: want to maybe feel something and there's 8770.08 - 8772.00: an anger in you already frustration from 8772.00 - 8774.28: day to day life life is hard and you 8774.28 - 8775.78: just want to channel that anger towards 8775.78 - 8777.88: something but I just the internet really 8777.88 - 8779.50: makes that easy for some reason and it 8779.50 - 8780.70: makes sense of your life that's the 8780.70 - 8782.56: problem it it for people whose lives are 8782.56 - 8783.52: chaos 8783.52 - 8786.04: hating you and blaming you gives order 8786.04 - 8788.14: to their lives yeah if it makes you 8788.14 - 8790.38: happy please continue 8790.38 - 8792.58: it seems to bother you though doesn't it 8792.58 - 8794.86: yeah I hate of any kind not towards me 8794.86 - 8796.84: just the people because I I think about 8796.84 - 8798.70: them and I I tend to think that most 8798.70 - 8801.28: people are amazing human beings and that 8801.28 - 8803.08: have a capacity do great things in this 8803.08 - 8805.90: world and so I just think 8805.90 - 8807.52: that's not a productive way of being 8807.52 - 8809.62: like psychologically for anything 8809.62 - 8812.02: whatsoever everybody has quirks that you 8812.02 - 8813.94: can hate but you just focus on the 8813.94 - 8815.62: really positive stuff and you celebrate 8815.62 - 8817.24: that stuff and that feels good that has 8817.24 - 8820.30: a momentum to it I guess the hate has a 8820.30 - 8821.92: momentum to it too and that's what I'm 8821.92 - 8823.72: trying to highlight if you follow the 8823.72 - 8826.18: momentum of hate that's going to maybe 8826.18 - 8828.46: feel good in the short term but it's not 8828.46 - 8830.38: it's gonna [ __ ] you over more and more 8830.38 - 8832.24: in your life and that's you have to be 8832.24 - 8833.80: cognizant of that as you interact with 8833.80 - 8835.06: the internet I agree with everything you 8835.06 - 8838.72: said but I think people who do things 8838.72 - 8841.30: that are influential and serious there 8841.30 - 8843.04: always are some people who hate them 8843.04 - 8845.62: I suppose that but I wanted to show the 8845.62 - 8847.92: difference between philosophical 8847.92 - 8850.36: disagreement that borders on hate and 8850.36 - 8852.76: like uh what's called like hate watching 8852.76 - 8855.46: where you just which is what I would say 8855.46 - 8859.24: TDs is which is your almost enjoying 8859.24 - 8860.98: how much you hate this person you're 8860.98 - 8863.20: sitting in their hate and you forgot you 8863.20 - 8865.30: lose all reason you lose everything Your 8865.30 - 8867.82: Capacity to think as an individual to 8867.82 - 8869.92: empathize with others use all of that 8869.92 - 8873.28: you're in this muck of hate and you and 8873.28 - 8876.52: it somehow it helps you make sense of 8876.52 - 8878.44: this particular difficult moment in your 8878.44 - 8881.38: life but otherwise it just it seems like 8881.38 - 8883.54: a shitty way to live but disagreement 8883.54 - 8885.64: definitely I like disagreement but I 8885.64 - 8887.50: guess what I'm saying is and I and I 8887.50 - 8889.36: think this is your message too right is 8889.36 - 8892.36: that um don't let the fact that people 8892.36 - 8893.92: don't like you or even that some people 8893.92 - 8895.48: hate you stop you from doing the right 8895.48 - 8897.76: thing think about how you can perhaps 8897.76 - 8899.92: trigger them less but don't stop what 8899.92 - 8901.90: you're doing I I see too many this is 8901.90 - 8903.70: why I bring this up too many of my 8903.70 - 8906.04: students too many young very talented 8906.04 - 8908.86: people who are afraid to take risks 8908.86 - 8911.08: because they're afraid that someone will 8911.08 - 8913.36: hate them and that can't get in your way 8913.36 - 8917.02: uh the reality is most people or there 8917.02 - 8919.48: will always be at least one person 8919.48 - 8921.58: that will get they will have you back 8921.58 - 8923.56: and they will support you and just focus 8923.56 - 8925.42: on them as long as you're doing the 8925.42 - 8927.76: right thing uh focus on them for the 8927.76 - 8930.46: strength but in general I'm exaggerating 8930.46 - 8933.52: here but because most of the time 99 of 8933.52 - 8934.66: people are supportive on the Internet 8934.66 - 8936.76: it's just something about the human 8936.76 - 8938.14: psychology 8938.14 - 8939.58: um really stands out to you when 8939.58 - 8941.68: somebody criticizes well it's easy on 8941.68 - 8943.06: the internet this is historically 8943.06 - 8944.62: different from where we were before and 8944.62 - 8946.90: as a society it's very easy now to say 8946.90 - 8948.88: hurtful things to people and not have to 8948.88 - 8950.62: even deal with them looking at you in 8950.62 - 8952.12: the face one of the things that one of 8952.12 - 8954.46: the things that encourages politeness is 8954.46 - 8955.78: the fact that we're looking at one 8955.78 - 8956.56: another 8956.56 - 8958.66: and I don't I we are naturally 8958.66 - 8960.88: programmed not to want the other person 8960.88 - 8964.30: to be to react to us in certain ways but 8964.30 - 8965.98: when we don't see their face 8965.98 - 8967.84: it's very easy to say all kinds of 8967.84 - 8969.34: things uh let me actually comment on 8969.34 - 8971.32: that point there's a lot of people on 8971.32 - 8974.62: the internet that say that I don't uh 8974.62 - 8976.72: sort of push back on points or criticize 8976.72 - 8978.46: people or ask the hard questions enough 8978.46 - 8980.68: first of all oftentimes I disagree with 8980.68 - 8983.68: that assessment but also 8983.68 - 8985.72: I don't think you guys realize how hard 8985.72 - 8987.40: that is to do when you're sitting with a 8987.40 - 8988.18: person 8988.18 - 8990.10: I don't care about access I don't care 8990.10 - 8991.90: about them being famous just on a basic 8991.90 - 8994.42: human level it's really hard to ask a 8994.42 - 8995.56: hard question 8995.56 - 8997.42: from a place of except when I'm sitting 8997.42 - 8999.28: here you see me really ask me no this is 8999.28 - 9000.66: a super fun I mean when there's 9000.66 - 9001.62: brilliant people like you there's 9001.62 - 9003.24: nothing to push back on that's it that's 9003.24 - 9004.92: that's that's easy but there's a basic 9004.92 - 9006.30: human thing 9006.30 - 9008.58: uh that doesn't I think it's almost 9008.58 - 9009.78: easier to be a journalist like 9009.78 - 9011.94: journalists do this well where they they 9011.94 - 9013.44: don't have a empathy for the person 9013.44 - 9015.32: they're just asking the hard questions 9015.32 - 9018.90: uh so where were you at this time last 9018.90 - 9020.94: night because that's very suspicious 9020.94 - 9022.80: it's in contradiction to what you said 9022.80 - 9025.14: and they're just doing factual stuff and 9025.14 - 9027.30: it if you actually truly have a 9027.30 - 9028.56: conversation within the human being you 9028.56 - 9031.74: empathize it's very difficult uh because 9031.74 - 9033.60: they have a story they have a vision of 9033.60 - 9035.64: themselves that that they're the good 9035.64 - 9039.06: person and to call somebody a liar while 9039.06 - 9041.28: having empathy basically imply that 9041.28 - 9043.98: they're a liar that's damn damn hard uh 9043.98 - 9047.52: so anyway but I'm I'm well set I agree 9047.52 - 9049.62: trying to figure this thing out can you 9049.62 - 9051.12: make the case that the January 6th 9051.12 - 9053.64: storming of the US capital is the big 9053.64 - 9055.62: deal and can you make the case that it 9055.62 - 9057.00: is not a big deal 9057.00 - 9059.58: I think the case is overwhelming that it 9059.58 - 9061.38: was a big deal and I opened the book 9061.38 - 9063.54: with this before going back to the end 9063.54 - 9064.74: of the Civil War because I think it 9064.74 - 9066.48: echoes that moment 9066.48 - 9069.30: um you had a group of people who 9069.30 - 9072.24: um literally tried to stop 9072.24 - 9074.58: the peaceful transfer of power 9074.58 - 9077.94: and were intending and his overwhelming 9077.94 - 9080.52: evidence of this if they had caught the 9080.52 - 9083.10: vice president or the Speaker of the 9083.10 - 9083.94: House 9083.94 - 9086.34: to do bodily harm to them or to kidnap 9086.34 - 9089.70: them so this was a coup d'etat that is a 9089.70 - 9091.02: definition of a coup d'etat when you try 9091.02 - 9093.54: to capture and prevent elected officials 9093.54 - 9095.58: from doing their job that's a huge deal 9095.58 - 9097.38: that had happened before in our country 9097.38 - 9100.26: in States I talk about this in Louisiana 9100.26 - 9102.30: in Tennessee and places like that after 9102.30 - 9104.22: the Civil War but it never happened in 9104.22 - 9106.26: the capital that's a huge deal that is 9106.26 - 9108.24: if I might say that's like third what we 9108.24 - 9109.74: would think of as third world behavior 9109.74 - 9112.08: in our society and no offense to those 9112.08 - 9113.34: from other parts of the world I'm just 9113.34 - 9114.60: trying to make a point is how we see 9114.60 - 9116.10: that as happening somewhere else not 9116.10 - 9118.74: here that's a big [ __ ] deal 9118.74 - 9121.44: uh the case that is not a big deal 9121.44 - 9123.36: I guess the case to make there is that 9123.36 - 9124.62: they didn't succeed 9124.62 - 9126.48: the case that is not a big deal is not 9126.48 - 9128.34: that their intentions were not bad I I 9128.34 - 9130.14: don't see how you can Define defend 9130.14 - 9132.66: their intentions the cases uh that the 9132.66 - 9133.80: case there's not a big deal so they're a 9133.80 - 9135.36: bunch of clowns 9135.36 - 9139.02: and uh yeah they broke in uh but in the 9139.02 - 9139.98: end once they got in there they didn't 9139.98 - 9141.72: know what to do which is true 9141.72 - 9144.90: and so you know I think a professional 9144.90 - 9147.00: couplotter would say these were the 9147.00 - 9148.08: amateurs 9148.08 - 9150.00: and that they had no real chance of 9150.00 - 9152.64: succeeding because once they got into 9152.64 - 9154.20: the capital they had no plan what to do 9154.20 - 9155.46: next what were they going to do you know 9155.46 - 9158.64: steal stapler from Nancy Pelosi's office 9158.64 - 9160.68: they didn't seem to have a plan and what 9160.68 - 9162.72: ended up happening they they left the 9162.72 - 9164.70: building would that that would be the 9164.70 - 9167.70: case that's not a big deal because their 9167.70 - 9170.58: intention was not to overthrow their 9170.58 - 9173.28: intention was to protest because if the 9173.28 - 9174.72: intention was to overthrow would be much 9174.72 - 9176.22: more organized I think the evidence is 9176.22 - 9177.66: pretty overwhelming that they intended 9177.66 - 9179.88: to to stop they were there to stop the 9179.88 - 9181.32: certification of the election they were 9181.32 - 9183.36: there to prevent Donald Trump from 9183.36 - 9185.58: having to leave office they just didn't 9185.58 - 9187.56: have a good plan this was the Keystone 9187.56 - 9188.64: Cops 9188.64 - 9191.22: so you're saying there is some POS like 9191.22 - 9193.56: statistically some possibility that this 9193.56 - 9194.70: would have 9194.70 - 9197.04: succeeded at halting the basic process 9197.04 - 9198.72: of democracy you could imagine a 9198.72 - 9199.86: scenario where it might have if they had 9199.86 - 9201.84: gotten lucky sure if they had if they 9201.84 - 9203.34: had caught the vice president 9203.34 - 9205.26: but what could have if they caught the 9205.26 - 9206.64: vice president they couldn't go on and 9206.64 - 9208.50: certify then he has to be there yeah but 9208.50 - 9209.70: don't you think that would resolve 9209.70 - 9211.62: itself through police action and so on 9211.62 - 9214.62: my question is how much how much is this 9214.62 - 9216.42: individual Hooligans 9216.42 - 9218.34: and how much of this is a gigantic 9218.34 - 9220.74: movement that's challenging the very 9220.74 - 9222.90: fabric well it's not a gigantic movement 9222.90 - 9225.60: but it was a small coup d'etat that 9225.60 - 9227.28: could have actually made the transition 9227.28 - 9228.72: much more difficult was there a scenario 9228.72 - 9229.92: where Donald Trump stayed in office 9229.92 - 9232.62: legitimately no but was there a scenario 9232.62 - 9234.90: where they created a great deal of chaos 9234.90 - 9236.76: that further undermine our democracy 9236.76 - 9238.20: actually yes here's how it would happen 9238.20 - 9241.14: right they capture Pence right they 9241.14 - 9243.90: either kidnap him and try to Ransom him 9243.90 - 9245.88: or they which is what they were trying 9245.88 - 9246.90: to do with the Michigan governor 9246.90 - 9249.96: governor Whitmer or they kill him and 9249.96 - 9251.70: then Donald Trump says okay well there's 9251.70 - 9253.44: no vice president so you can't certify 9253.44 - 9255.60: the Senate would choose someone else to 9255.60 - 9257.16: be vice president but Donald Trump says 9257.16 - 9258.42: no that's not legitimate I think it's 9258.42 - 9259.92: possible Donald Trump would say 9259.92 - 9261.90: something like that absolutely 9261.90 - 9264.90: I disagree with you he said that morning 9264.90 - 9267.30: that Penn should not certify he said 9267.30 - 9268.62: that morning but there's a difference 9268.62 - 9270.96: between sort of Twitter rhetoric no no 9270.96 - 9273.42: he said it at a rally sure rally 9273.42 - 9276.42: rhetoric and there is a threshold it 9276.42 - 9278.34: feels like a big leap he asked people 9278.34 - 9280.74: around him in the Oval Office how he 9280.74 - 9282.72: could make that happen he tried to get a 9282.72 - 9284.40: new person appointed attorney general 9284.40 - 9286.86: who would do that he tried to find legal 9286.86 - 9289.62: justification for it I I think the 9289.62 - 9292.56: evidence is overwhelming that Trump was 9292.56 - 9295.50: supportive of efforts after the election 9295.50 - 9297.84: didn't go the way he wanted to keep him 9297.84 - 9299.10: in office 9299.10 - 9301.56: and and whether that's legally 9301.56 - 9303.96: actionable and whether one thinks that 9303.96 - 9306.12: means he's a bad president or not isn't 9306.12 - 9309.72: a matter of opinion but facts are facts 9309.72 - 9311.82: yeah I just wonder if it's possible for 9311.82 - 9313.74: him to have stayed president in this in 9313.74 - 9315.24: this kind of context you know he seems 9315.24 - 9316.38: like a heated just like you said 9316.38 - 9319.38: elections can even be violent uh they're 9319.38 - 9321.42: they're heated people are very upset 9321.42 - 9324.06: when Donald Trump won the presidency in 9324.06 - 9327.66: 2016 I was in Cambridge Massachusetts 9327.66 - 9330.74: uh the amount of anger 9330.74 - 9334.26: uh I was just get the energy I was 9334.26 - 9338.10: getting from people I mean that I if if 9338.10 - 9339.96: there was any way to channel that anger 9339.96 - 9341.46: I think people would be in trouble but 9341.46 - 9343.32: let's but let's anger yeah I agree with 9343.32 - 9345.42: that and that is right and elections are 9345.42 - 9347.28: violent as I said but this is different 9347.28 - 9351.18: this this is the person in the office of 9351.18 - 9353.28: the presidency using the power of the 9353.28 - 9356.58: presidency to try to stay in office to 9356.58 - 9359.22: imperil people's lives to distort our 9359.22 - 9361.20: government on a scale we had not seen 9361.20 - 9363.90: before and and these are not opinions of 9363.90 - 9366.12: mine we have the documentary evidence we 9366.12 - 9367.92: have the testimony from people about 9367.92 - 9370.20: this we can differ over what you think 9370.20 - 9372.12: of his presidency as a whole 9372.12 - 9373.92: we can differ over whether you think he 9373.92 - 9375.48: should be held legally responsible those 9375.48 - 9378.06: are matters of opinion but the facts are 9378.06 - 9382.02: he sat on January 6th watched it on TV 9382.02 - 9384.90: did not send ever 9384.90 - 9387.48: ever did he ever send any protection for 9387.48 - 9389.64: Congress that is his job 9389.64 - 9393.12: and throughout asked continue to ask how 9393.12 - 9395.46: this could the certification could be 9395.46 - 9397.92: prevented to you that's not incompetence 9397.92 - 9400.74: that's malevolence absolutely 9400.74 - 9403.44: if I watch my children 9403.44 - 9405.54: getting harmed and I don't do something 9405.54 - 9408.36: about it I'm watching it and in fact I 9408.36 - 9411.72: take action that tries to help those who 9411.72 - 9413.76: are doing the harm you would not just 9413.76 - 9415.02: say I'm an incompetent president you 9415.02 - 9416.46: would apparent you would say it was a 9416.46 - 9418.08: negligent parent and you'd call parental 9418.08 - 9420.50: support to take away my children 9420.50 - 9422.70: I was troubled by the way the Press 9422.70 - 9424.62: covered it that they politicized the 9424.62 - 9426.72: crap out of that 9426.72 - 9427.74: um 9427.74 - 9430.14: and not not just the Press but also 9430.14 - 9431.94: Congress itself it just seemed like 9431.94 - 9433.86: impeachment and all this that just 9433.86 - 9435.60: seemed to be a kind of circus that 9435.60 - 9438.84: wasn't interested in in democracy or 9438.84 - 9441.54: non-partisanship 9441.54 - 9444.78: I don't so it's very difficult for me to 9444.78 - 9447.06: see the situation in with clear eyes 9447.06 - 9449.46: because it's been colored by the Press I 9449.46 - 9450.84: got it's very difficult for me to know 9450.84 - 9452.28: what is even true 9452.28 - 9454.14: members of Congress 9454.14 - 9455.88: including our members of Congress from 9455.88 - 9457.98: our district and others right 9457.98 - 9460.26: their lives were threatened 9460.26 - 9462.54: they've been traumatized 9462.54 - 9464.64: I have a lot of students at least a 9464.64 - 9466.74: dozen who are staff members 9466.74 - 9469.62: more than half are Republicans 9469.62 - 9472.32: part of what traumatized them 9472.32 - 9475.14: was that the president did not do his 9475.14 - 9477.66: job to not protect them yes as a child 9477.66 - 9480.60: would be traumatized not only if harmed 9480.60 - 9482.40: by someone but if Mom and Dad don't do 9482.40 - 9483.78: everything they can one of the things 9483.78 - 9485.40: that makes people feel safe is they know 9485.40 - 9486.78: their parents they know their personal 9486.78 - 9488.76: Authority can't always keep them safe 9488.76 - 9489.66: but they want to know the person's 9489.66 - 9491.82: always trying I agree with you that 9491.82 - 9494.40: they're listen I'm a I'm somebody that 9494.40 - 9496.50: believes in this kind of idea of family 9496.50 - 9498.12: especially people I work with that that 9498.12 - 9500.88: to me is a high ideal to protect but 9500.88 - 9502.80: that's a little bit different it's his 9502.80 - 9505.44: job that's a little bit different than 9505.44 - 9507.06: protecting democracy those are two 9507.06 - 9508.92: different things protecting the your 9508.92 - 9511.68: employees and protecting democracy is an 9511.68 - 9514.08: ideal no you could say he didn't protect 9514.08 - 9516.96: either but I think the criticism that he 9516.96 - 9518.22: didn't protect the employees is one 9518.22 - 9520.26: thing but the employees in this case are 9520.26 - 9522.48: the ones carrying out democracy so it's 9522.48 - 9523.98: like saying the general who doesn't 9523.98 - 9526.32: protect his soldiers is maybe not 9526.32 - 9527.64: protecting his employees he's also not 9527.64 - 9530.04: protecting the war effort right it is 9530.04 - 9531.54: his that the people we're talking about 9531.54 - 9532.98: the people who are actually doing the 9532.98 - 9534.30: work of democracy at that moment the 9534.30 - 9536.34: most basic function of democracy which 9536.34 - 9538.08: is certifying votes 9538.08 - 9540.54: and their lives with I I I'm telling you 9540.54 - 9543.12: I had I had students one who works for 9543.12 - 9545.82: Senator Romney for example who spent 9545.82 - 9547.92: hours in a closet 9547.92 - 9551.10: hearing people outside looking on her 9551.10 - 9552.96: phone when is the president sending 9552.96 - 9555.60: people to protect us so we can do our 9555.60 - 9557.04: job and she was not happy with the way 9557.04 - 9558.30: the election turned out but she was 9558.30 - 9560.46: there to do her job because she believes 9560.46 - 9562.80: in democracy to serve as the senate in 9562.80 - 9564.30: the Senate's rule what should have 9564.30 - 9566.40: Donald Trump done without turning him 9566.40 - 9567.84: into a different human being he should 9567.84 - 9569.22: have immediately 9569.22 - 9571.86: it the just as we were watching things 9571.86 - 9573.36: get breached the moment they had that 9573.36 - 9574.62: the members of the house and the senate 9574.62 - 9576.90: had to evacuate their respective 9576.90 - 9579.90: Chambers he should have immediately gone 9579.90 - 9582.42: on TV and Twitter and every space he 9582.42 - 9585.12: could and tell his supporters to leave 9585.12 - 9587.22: and say what he never said 9587.22 - 9589.14: this is Un-American what you're doing 9589.14 - 9590.88: this is unacceptable we never use those 9590.88 - 9592.20: words this is Un-American this is 9592.20 - 9593.90: unacceptable I am completely against 9593.90 - 9596.76: anyone storming the capital like this go 9596.76 - 9598.92: home now please or you can use his own 9598.92 - 9600.84: language but tell him to leave yeah and 9600.84 - 9602.40: immediately as soon as we know he was 9602.40 - 9604.86: watching for hours and we have testimony 9604.86 - 9607.20: from his own daughter from Ivanka saying 9607.20 - 9609.00: she tried time and again to get him to 9609.00 - 9610.38: say something earlier on and he didn't 9610.38 - 9612.42: he watched it 9612.42 - 9614.64: he can still criticize 9614.64 - 9616.56: all the politicians he can criticize 9616.56 - 9617.64: everyone he wants but he should have 9617.64 - 9618.72: told him to leave all you should do in 9618.72 - 9621.54: that moment is basic a protecting 9621.54 - 9624.18: democracy protecting the capital Leaf 9624.18 - 9625.62: tell them to leave and do everything he 9625.62 - 9627.06: can to find any kind of force he can 9627.06 - 9629.90: give to go protect the capital 9629.90 - 9632.76: I wonder how difficult it is to lose a 9632.76 - 9634.56: presidential election 9634.56 - 9636.54: it's happened so many times we know I 9636.54 - 9638.82: understand that but it's uh 9638.82 - 9641.94: especially when like what is it you know 9641.94 - 9644.34: uh 80 million people vote for you or 9644.34 - 9646.62: like some like millions and millions and 9646.62 - 9648.00: millions of people vote for you it's 9648.00 - 9650.40: crazy it's crazy this democracy thing is 9650.40 - 9653.94: crazy George H.W bush yeah won a war in 9653.94 - 9656.76: the Middle East right he had 90 approval 9656.76 - 9658.20: rating and then a year later lost the 9658.20 - 9660.42: election to someone Bill Clinton he 9660.42 - 9662.34: thought had none of the experience he 9662.34 - 9663.84: had someone didn't have he believed 9663.84 - 9666.42: didn't have the right moral character 9666.42 - 9669.24: and Bush did everything he could to help 9669.24 - 9670.86: the next president get started well and 9670.86 - 9673.44: they became good friends yeah George W 9673.44 - 9674.58: bush 9674.58 - 9676.86: if didn't love Obama 9676.86 - 9678.66: that's considered one of the smoothest 9678.66 - 9681.24: transitions George W bush ordered every 9681.24 - 9684.00: single person in his administration to 9684.00 - 9685.44: do everything they could to help the new 9685.44 - 9687.30: admit that's that's what a leader does 9687.30 - 9689.16: yeah humility is one of the things I 9689.16 - 9692.94: admire in leaders 9692.94 - 9695.30: well that felt heated 9695.30 - 9698.52: speaking of which uh can you just Linger 9698.52 - 9700.44: on how how do you think we can heal the 9700.44 - 9701.82: divide in this country do you think it's 9701.82 - 9703.44: possible there feels to be a strong 9703.44 - 9705.48: Division I think we can heal the Divide 9705.48 - 9706.62: I think 9706.62 - 9708.12: um as you said there's so many 9708.12 - 9709.74: opportunities with new technology to 9709.74 - 9711.36: bring people together just as we're 9711.36 - 9713.70: using it to tear them apart 9713.70 - 9716.10: um I I have the best job in the world 9716.10 - 9719.16: because I get to teach so many students 9719.16 - 9722.40: uh of 300 in my class in the spring in a 9722.40 - 9724.68: U.S history class and what I found with 9724.68 - 9726.24: my students is they're mostly not 9726.24 - 9728.04: Democrats or Republicans 9728.04 - 9729.72: they mostly care about the same things 9729.72 - 9731.40: every one of my students seems to care 9731.40 - 9732.78: about climate change 9732.78 - 9734.40: I thought you're going to say Tick Tock 9734.40 - 9736.74: but okay yeah second second to that 9736.74 - 9739.20: climate change you know and and I think 9739.20 - 9741.20: they um 9741.20 - 9744.84: I think they offer a a new future for us 9744.84 - 9746.22: and here's what I'll say as a historian 9746.22 - 9748.80: we go through cycles of division and 9748.80 - 9750.42: cycles of less division less 9750.42 - 9753.12: partisanship one moment when it seems 9753.12 - 9755.04: people agree too much on the mainstream 9755.04 - 9756.60: encourages people to go to the extremes 9756.60 - 9758.88: when people see the extremes they want 9758.88 - 9760.74: to come back to the middle and that is 9760.74 - 9762.24: where my students are most of my 9762.24 - 9765.66: students want uh lower inflation 9765.66 - 9767.70: they agree with Republicans on that but 9767.70 - 9769.02: they want more more to be done about 9769.02 - 9770.52: climate change they're they're in the 9770.52 - 9771.84: middle on these issues and and I think 9771.84 - 9774.54: giving them more more opportunity so 9774.54 - 9776.04: what's the best way to heal our 9776.04 - 9777.78: divisions honestly 9777.78 - 9780.06: get the old men out and the young women 9780.06 - 9782.28: and men in because they ultimately don't 9782.28 - 9784.20: have that same division in them like 9784.20 - 9786.30: deeply baked in not only that they they 9786.30 - 9788.34: were they they find it disgusting in the 9788.34 - 9791.46: way you and I do yeah that's true what's 9791.46 - 9793.74: the right way to have conversations I 9793.74 - 9796.02: mean just just to stay on that with 9796.02 - 9798.14: people on the left and the right 9798.14 - 9800.76: uh yeah I mean I don't know how often 9800.76 - 9801.84: you practice this you care about 9801.84 - 9803.40: politics how often do you talk to people 9803.40 - 9806.22: who um who voted for Trump or who are 9806.22 - 9808.08: Republicans it's hard I try but it's 9808.08 - 9811.14: hard 75 of people I talk to 9811.14 - 9812.76: are not those people do you have people 9812.76 - 9814.32: who are trying to support it in your 9814.32 - 9817.32: extended family 9817.32 - 9819.90: Thanksgiving no I don't in my extended 9819.90 - 9821.90: are they are they no longer 9821.90 - 9826.82: no longer in my family yeah 9826.82 - 9829.86: I have taken them out of the photos yeah 9829.86 - 9832.50: you just erase yeah I do uh but I know P 9832.50 - 9834.96: I have friends yeah who fall into that 9834.96 - 9836.70: but it's it's still a minority of my 9836.70 - 9837.96: friend group so I want to you know be 9837.96 - 9839.70: clear that I'm not as good at this as I 9839.70 - 9842.04: should but I think we do have to reach 9842.04 - 9845.22: out but but I also I I'm less interested 9845.22 - 9848.06: honestly in 9848.06 - 9851.28: re-fighting old battles with old dogs 9851.28 - 9854.40: I'm more interested in finding ways to 9854.40 - 9856.92: get a new crop of people 9856.92 - 9860.28: educated and involved and engaged 9860.28 - 9863.82: without imparting the same the same 9863.82 - 9866.94: partisanship on them so I I will support 9866.94 - 9869.28: I mean this I have to I will support and 9869.28 - 9871.02: encourage especially any student of mine 9871.02 - 9874.02: but any young person who is smart has 9874.02 - 9875.82: good ideas I don't care whether I don't 9875.82 - 9877.56: ask whether a Democrat or Republican and 9877.56 - 9878.70: I have given money to some young 9878.70 - 9881.34: candidates who are not Democrats 9881.34 - 9883.08: um so that that's the way I I think it's 9883.08 - 9884.82: it's a generational change 9884.82 - 9887.52: and I think it's reaching out uh and 9887.52 - 9888.90: trying to 9888.90 - 9891.30: get people to see beyond partisan 9891.30 - 9894.06: divisions who are in their 20s and teens 9894.06 - 9895.50: rather than that's why we do our podcast 9895.50 - 9897.66: that this is democracy Zachary and I do 9897.66 - 9899.82: that my son and I because we're exactly 9899.82 - 9901.02: that you will never hear an episode 9901.02 - 9903.48: where we take one side or another our 9903.48 - 9905.76: goal is to explain the issue whether 9905.76 - 9908.46: it's uh the challenges of democracy in 9908.46 - 9909.30: China 9909.30 - 9912.80: or it's climate change or whatever it is 9912.80 - 9916.86: or its memory of war in our society and 9916.86 - 9918.30: to explain the issue and then offer 9918.30 - 9919.98: people an optimistic pathway that's on 9919.98 - 9921.72: either one side nor the other so 9921.72 - 9923.40: actually to push back a little bit on 9923.40 - 9926.04: young people I do see that uh this is 9926.04 - 9927.42: the exhaustion with the sort of 9927.42 - 9930.00: partisanship but I've also and this I 9930.00 - 9931.68: think is the case throughout history and 9931.68 - 9934.02: I see it now especially in the in the 9934.02 - 9935.28: teenage years 9935.28 - 9938.28: especially if I'm being asked with boys 9938.28 - 9941.22: there's a desire for extremism in 9941.22 - 9943.50: various directions all kinds of 9943.50 - 9945.96: extremism like just extreme 9945.96 - 9948.60: awesomeness or extreme anything just 9948.60 - 9951.96: extreme and F the man that tries to make 9951.96 - 9954.42: me behave this kind of energy and that's 9954.42 - 9957.00: why you can take any ideology basically 9957.00 - 9958.50: any extreme ideology stops being 9958.50 - 9960.24: exciting whether you're a Marxist or a 9960.24 - 9961.98: communist you're not just going to be 9961.98 - 9964.32: like for socialized health care you're 9964.32 - 9967.38: gonna be like no no no no let's go full 9967.38 - 9970.08: hammer and sickle yep I'm gonna wear red 9970.08 - 9972.84: and then the same with the white 9972.84 - 9977.28: supremacy or uh just a red pill this the 9977.28 - 9979.20: way you you see you the way you see 9979.20 - 9980.82: Society the way you see the world the 9980.82 - 9983.82: extremism is there and part of that it's 9983.82 - 9986.34: kind of uh to steal that perspective and 9986.34 - 9988.74: it can be productive that energy if it's 9988.74 - 9990.68: controlled and especially if we have 9990.68 - 9993.06: institutions that keep it a little under 9993.06 - 9996.12: like control one of the criticisms I 9996.12 - 9998.46: have with with a lot of people have I 9998.46 - 10000.98: I'm I'm actually much more moderate than 10000.98 - 10002.96: that criticism of universities as they 10002.96 - 10004.40: give a little too much power to the 18 10004.40 - 10006.38: year old who just showed up with their 10006.38 - 10008.66: Marxist like books and so on and they 10008.66 - 10009.86: they want to burn the whole thing down 10009.86 - 10012.62: that's beautiful but the whole process 10012.62 - 10014.12: of the universities get different 10014.12 - 10018.02: viewpoints educate uh more make that 10018.02 - 10020.42: person's Viewpoint more sophisticated 10020.42 - 10022.46: complex nuance and all that kind of yeah 10022.46 - 10024.38: I think you're right but I think that's 10024.38 - 10027.14: more talk than action in my experience 10027.14 - 10029.54: there is especially among young men 10029.54 - 10031.94: you're absolutely right there is a 10031.94 - 10034.34: valorization of the tough guy 10034.34 - 10037.94: because most men 18 and 19 are still not 10037.94 - 10039.50: fully comfortable in their masculinity 10039.50 - 10041.90: however they're going to Define it and 10041.90 - 10045.50: so a way of of Performing that is being 10045.50 - 10047.54: extreme in one way or another and and 10047.54 - 10049.82: I've definitely seen that but I think 10049.82 - 10052.70: it's it's more often than not rhetoric 10052.70 - 10054.20: and actually 10054.20 - 10057.02: there's a very strong power of peer 10057.02 - 10058.46: pressure and Conformity that works on 10058.46 - 10060.68: young people and the positive side of 10060.68 - 10063.68: that now is the peer pressure among them 10063.68 - 10065.66: is not to join one party or the other 10065.66 - 10067.34: it's to say this is this is terrible 10067.34 - 10069.26: look at how our parents are screwing 10069.26 - 10072.44: things up and they're right and I think 10072.44 - 10074.72: we can lean into that and get a lot of 10074.72 - 10077.78: positive creative action uh out of that 10077.78 - 10079.70: on universities you brought this up a 10079.70 - 10081.62: few times and and I think we have to be 10081.62 - 10083.54: careful I think you and I agree on this 10083.54 - 10084.68: um it's not that universities are free 10084.68 - 10086.90: of bias the universities especially 10086.90 - 10089.24: large universities whether it's UT MIT 10089.24 - 10091.52: Yale whatever we're talking about right 10091.52 - 10094.54: uh they're large complex Empires 10094.54 - 10097.82: and most universities people in the Arts 10097.82 - 10099.68: tend to be a little left of center at 10099.68 - 10100.82: self-selection 10100.82 - 10102.74: those in engineering tend to be pretty 10102.74 - 10104.78: much in the middle and those at Business 10104.78 - 10106.94: Schools tend to be right of Center 10106.94 - 10108.92: and so I think we need to be careful not 10108.92 - 10111.08: to to generalize 10111.08 - 10112.34: um you know at the University of Texas 10112.34 - 10114.44: there's as much influence from the 10114.44 - 10115.64: business school and the athletic 10115.64 - 10117.50: department as there is from the 10117.50 - 10120.92: humanities uh so it's not a left-leaning 10120.92 - 10123.26: campus and that's also true at at Yale 10123.26 - 10124.58: you have the School of Management and 10124.58 - 10126.74: you know you have a huge uh medical 10126.74 - 10128.66: school right people who are very 10128.66 - 10131.12: professional uh and less political on a 10131.12 - 10132.92: lot of these issues so so I think we 10132.92 - 10133.76: have to be careful I think there's 10133.76 - 10135.62: certain pockets of things 10135.62 - 10137.30: but some of that you're never going to 10137.30 - 10139.40: avoid right Engineers are always going 10139.40 - 10142.94: to be the people who hey now what do you 10142.94 - 10145.58: I'm sure who who who want to generally 10145.58 - 10148.10: find some objective measure and avoid 10148.10 - 10149.66: political interpretation right they want 10149.66 - 10151.46: to find their objective measure I'm 10151.46 - 10153.32: surprised of how most people in like 10153.32 - 10154.94: robotics don't seem to they're afraid of 10154.94 - 10156.64: humans they run away from you precisely 10156.64 - 10159.44: precisely and and the Arts people are 10159.44 - 10161.12: always going to be more touchy-feely and 10161.12 - 10162.08: the business people are always going to 10162.08 - 10164.30: like markets I mean my own personal 10164.30 - 10167.66: opinion on this is uh this is just me 10167.66 - 10168.56: talking 10168.56 - 10170.54: yeah and it's I don't know if it's 10170.54 - 10172.46: grounded in data but just my own 10172.46 - 10175.22: experiences it seems a lot of the things 10175.22 - 10176.84: that people criticize about universities 10176.84 - 10178.70: comes from administrations from the 10178.70 - 10180.56: bureaucracies the faculty and the 10180.56 - 10184.16: students are even with biases are really 10184.16 - 10186.08: interesting people and all of their 10186.08 - 10187.70: different I wouldn't call them biases 10187.70 - 10189.98: but different perspectives add to the 10189.98 - 10192.56: conversation it's the administrator too 10192.56 - 10194.06: much of course you need just like with 10194.06 - 10196.64: institutions you need some but too much 10196.64 - 10199.58: it becomes too heavy-handed and 10199.58 - 10202.34: um somehow that has been getting a 10202.34 - 10203.90: little bit out of hand at a bunch of 10203.90 - 10205.34: universities just too much too much 10205.34 - 10207.14: Administration and I don't know what the 10207.14 - 10209.06: mechanism is to let to make it more 10209.06 - 10210.62: efficient but that's been always a 10210.62 - 10212.48: struggle maybe the public criticism is 10212.48 - 10213.68: the very mechanism that makes 10213.68 - 10216.38: universities the administration smaller 10216.38 - 10217.94: absolutely we have we have those issues 10217.94 - 10219.92: and off you can also say Athletics has 10219.92 - 10222.52: gotten out of control sure yeah 10222.52 - 10225.44: like you said you co-host a podcast with 10225.44 - 10227.36: your son Zachary called This is 10227.36 - 10229.88: democracy what it's been 10229.88 - 10232.52: has a million question I can ask but uh 10232.52 - 10234.92: just that pops the memory what's been a 10234.92 - 10236.54: challenging or maybe an eye-opening 10236.54 - 10238.22: conversation you've had on it 10238.22 - 10240.26: oh we've had a lot of eye-opening 10240.26 - 10243.38: conversations our most recent episode 10243.38 - 10247.34: um is an episode on the German right as 10247.34 - 10249.38: as I'm sure many of your your listeners 10249.38 - 10252.02: know there was a group uh called the 10252.02 - 10253.94: reichberger I think they still exist in 10253.94 - 10255.20: Germany they were actually led by a 10255.20 - 10258.56: former German Prince uh and 10258.56 - 10260.90: um they had been planning to assassinate 10260.90 - 10263.42: the bundes counselor and we're 10263.42 - 10265.04: organizing all sorts of other efforts 10265.04 - 10268.10: they do not believe that the current 10268.10 - 10269.54: German government is legitimate they 10269.54 - 10270.98: think the last legitimate government was 10270.98 - 10272.24: the Nazi government they see the whole 10272.24 - 10274.04: post-war period is illegitimate this is 10274.04 - 10276.74: the German far-right correct and we had 10276.74 - 10279.62: on uh a member of the German bundestag 10279.62 - 10281.66: of their Parliament who's been involved 10281.66 - 10283.28: in the investigations or in the 10283.28 - 10285.80: oversight of the investigations and 10285.80 - 10288.80: talking with her about the depth of 10288.80 - 10290.60: these issues and the challenges they 10290.60 - 10292.76: face in Germany it's certainly not a 10292.76 - 10294.74: huge part of German Society but it's a 10294.74 - 10296.24: significant number of people probably 10296.24 - 10297.80: more than 20 000 people who are part of 10297.80 - 10299.06: this 10299.06 - 10301.28: um to me brought home 10301.28 - 10304.16: how much of what we thought was the past 10304.16 - 10306.14: is still in the present and I think 10306.14 - 10308.54: that's a recurring theme in our in our 10308.54 - 10310.58: show and our show is optimistic it's not 10310.58 - 10313.34: about woes to the world it's actually 10313.34 - 10315.32: about taking issues we take a topic each 10315.32 - 10317.06: week that's in the news we go back to 10317.06 - 10319.10: understand the history and we then use 10319.10 - 10320.78: that history to make better policy to 10320.78 - 10322.28: talk about how to make better policy 10322.28 - 10325.58: today and in this case it was clear that 10325.58 - 10327.32: even in Germany there's a lot of 10327.32 - 10330.08: Unfinished work in explaining to people 10330.08 - 10332.42: and helping those for instance in the 10332.42 - 10334.70: former East where a lot of this group 10334.70 - 10336.02: has its support 10336.02 - 10338.24: why this government is legitimate why it 10338.24 - 10339.92: operates the way it does and addressing 10339.92 - 10342.02: their concerns it it was strikingly 10342.02 - 10343.58: similar to some of the problems we have 10343.58 - 10345.98: in our own yes that there's a Far Right 10345.98 - 10347.48: movement in Germany so you look at all 10347.48 - 10350.06: different parts of the world as well we 10350.06 - 10352.76: do we we did an episode recently on uh 10352.76 - 10354.86: China on the effects of zero covid and 10354.86 - 10357.20: the protests in China uh we've done a 10357.20 - 10358.76: number of episodes on the war in Ukraine 10358.76 - 10361.82: our our role each week is to have on 10361.82 - 10364.52: either a policy maker a scholar or an 10364.52 - 10366.92: activist who can help us understand an 10366.92 - 10369.20: issue and get Beyond partisanship so 10369.20 - 10370.58: what's been eye-opening are some of the 10370.58 - 10372.20: details but what's also been eye-opening 10372.20 - 10374.48: honestly is how easy it is to have a 10374.48 - 10376.34: nonpartisan conversation 10376.34 - 10377.90: it's not hard 10377.90 - 10380.18: uh we open every episode with a poem 10380.18 - 10381.50: that Zachary writes he writes an 10381.50 - 10383.30: original poem I'll brag on my son he's 10383.30 - 10385.70: the youth Poet Laureate in Austin right 10385.70 - 10387.80: now and he writes a poem on each topic 10387.80 - 10390.26: what's the style of poetry usually you 10390.26 - 10392.06: know he's dark is he no he's usually 10392.06 - 10395.42: he's he's often ironic ironic like with 10395.42 - 10397.88: a bit of humor yes okay and he likes 10397.88 - 10399.68: word plays so he's not like a rebellious 10399.68 - 10403.46: dark uh teenager that's just no he's a 10403.46 - 10405.98: creative know-it-all 10405.98 - 10408.50: strong words he would probably disagree 10408.50 - 10409.82: um but what's interesting I was like 10409.82 - 10413.48: you're the you know it all oh no 10413.48 - 10415.40: we do have a lot of followers uh and 10415.40 - 10416.66: most of them comment on him they don't 10416.66 - 10418.40: comment on me so I'm the junior partner 10418.40 - 10420.68: you're the Yoko Ono of the partnership 10420.68 - 10422.72: correct I'm scared but what I will say 10422.72 - 10424.46: and this is a really optimistic thing 10424.46 - 10426.68: that I deeply believe if you frame 10426.68 - 10429.38: things properly you open with a poem you 10429.38 - 10431.24: open with questions not with partisan 10431.24 - 10433.40: positions uh even when we have someone 10433.40 - 10435.62: on who's a known Republican or Democrat 10435.62 - 10437.72: we can have a very non-partisan 10437.72 - 10439.64: conversation I mean of course we get 10439.64 - 10440.90: criticisms but we're almost never 10440.90 - 10444.02: criticized for being uh partisan one way 10444.02 - 10445.58: or the other it's not hard to do this 10445.58 - 10448.04: you just have to make an effort to avoid 10448.04 - 10450.62: the the partisan claptrap that we can 10450.62 - 10453.56: all fall into focus on the humanity what 10453.56 - 10456.14: is your brilliant popular son Zachary 10456.14 - 10458.78: taught you about life 10458.78 - 10460.82: always taught me so much in his 18 years 10460.82 - 10463.64: as has our daughter who's 20. two things 10463.64 - 10467.84: stand out he's taught me that um a new 10467.84 - 10470.30: generation has so much to offer 10470.30 - 10472.22: and I don't just mean because he's smart 10472.22 - 10474.14: and engaged as our daughter is too I I 10474.14 - 10476.00: also mean that you realize when you have 10476.00 - 10476.78: a child 10476.78 - 10478.10: that even though you're doing the same 10478.10 - 10479.18: things with them they see the world 10479.18 - 10481.58: differently and legitimately and it 10481.58 - 10483.62: reminds us that the world can be seen 10483.62 - 10485.48: legitimately in different ways 10485.48 - 10487.58: and it's not that he and I disagree on 10487.58 - 10489.20: major political issues it's actually the 10489.20 - 10491.36: small stuff that he sees differently 10491.36 - 10493.34: like in the details you see that you can 10493.34 - 10495.26: have a very different perspectives 10495.26 - 10497.12: exactly you have a very way different 10497.12 - 10499.76: way to draw to create a painting of the 10499.76 - 10501.74: same scene and then the other thing he's 10501.74 - 10502.88: taught me 10502.88 - 10505.22: um is as I said about the Poetry the 10505.22 - 10507.38: importance of the Arts I've always been 10507.38 - 10510.14: a a lover of the Arts but it had always 10510.14 - 10512.48: been in some ways parallel to my 10512.48 - 10514.40: historical scholarship we need to do a 10514.40 - 10517.34: better job of integrating as as as the 10517.34 - 10520.70: Greeks did right the Artistry all the 10520.70 - 10522.26: things we do we separate them as 10522.26 - 10524.12: disciplines but they're all deeply 10524.12 - 10525.56: connected this is what I like about your 10525.56 - 10527.30: podcast honestly is that you integrate 10527.30 - 10528.56: all these things you'll have people on 10528.56 - 10530.24: with AI you'll have a guy doing arm 10530.24 - 10531.44: wrestling you have all these things 10531.44 - 10534.62: together right and it's it's that these 10534.62 - 10536.12: worlds come together 10536.12 - 10538.58: and there's a lot to gain by bringing 10538.58 - 10539.96: the Arts and the sciences and all this 10539.96 - 10540.92: together it's an obvious thing to say 10540.92 - 10543.08: but we forget yeah and it somehow it 10543.08 - 10546.74: becomes bigger than the individual Parts 10546.74 - 10548.30: um what gives you hope about the future 10548.30 - 10550.88: you looked at especially with this book 10550.88 - 10553.34: and just such a divisive 10553.34 - 10556.94: part of our history and the claim the 10556.94 - 10558.38: idea that you carry through the book 10558.38 - 10560.54: that that division still permeates our 10560.54 - 10562.70: society so what gives you hope I try to 10562.70 - 10563.84: end the book on a very hopeful note 10563.84 - 10566.42: because I am hopeful I'm hopeful that 10566.42 - 10569.90: these divisions were made by people and 10569.90 - 10573.14: can be unmade by people I do not believe 10573.14 - 10575.96: that what I describe in this book The 10575.96 - 10578.30: Division the the hate that we see today 10578.30 - 10582.26: as well I don't think it's inevitable 10582.26 - 10584.36: I think it can be actually corrected 10584.36 - 10585.74: quite easily 10585.74 - 10589.04: and corrected easily by addressing the 10589.04 - 10590.66: challenges in our institutions the ways 10590.66 - 10592.22: in which this history has been embodied 10592.22 - 10593.66: in our institutions even though we're 10593.66 - 10594.62: different 10594.62 - 10597.62: and uh through our own recognizing of it 10597.62 - 10599.18: the gift of the last few years I don't 10599.18 - 10600.02: care whether you're a Democrat or 10600.02 - 10601.28: Republican the gift of the last few 10601.28 - 10603.68: years is that we've been able to see the 10603.68 - 10606.02: horror around us and once you see the 10606.02 - 10607.40: horror you can do something about it 10607.40 - 10609.20: what's dangerous is when the horror is 10609.20 - 10610.52: there and you don't see it and it's 10610.52 - 10612.74: hidden it's been unmasked I don't care 10612.74 - 10615.20: where you stand I think I I I probably 10615.20 - 10617.12: spoken in about 25 30 cities about this 10617.12 - 10619.40: book every audience I've asked how many 10619.40 - 10621.08: of you have been shaken by the last four 10621.08 - 10622.94: to five years and everyone everywhere 10622.94 - 10624.50: has raised their hand 10624.50 - 10626.96: that's a gift that's Consciousness 10626.96 - 10630.14: raising I grew up in a time in the 1980s 10630.14 - 10631.82: uh when we were concerned everyone was 10631.82 - 10633.50: apathetic that was what was was being 10633.50 - 10635.54: said we had lower vote voter turnout 10635.54 - 10637.28: than we have now people didn't seem to 10637.28 - 10638.18: care 10638.18 -
